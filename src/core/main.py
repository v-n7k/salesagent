#:     The builder now takes the object it advertises; graded by
#:     TestAdvertisedTypesAreAccepted, which constructs the advertised type and calls the real
#:     builder. That test exists because the name-dimension rule could not see a TYPE widening.
#:   * some object-typed parameters carry their description on the referenced $def rather than
#:     inline. Cosmetic, tracked separately; it never affected what buyers may send.

    The request DTO is RESOLVED FROM THE REGISTRY ROW. There is no parameter to pass one
    explicitly: the escape hatch that allowed it is gone, so "registered with a hand-supplied
    DTO" is not a state this function can produce.

    It existed for list_tasks, whose pre-3.1.1 vocabulary intersected the SDK model at
    ``context`` alone. Rebasing that tool onto the spec shape left the parameter with zero
    users, and a zero-user escape hatch is one refactor away from being used again -- so it
    is deleted rather than documented as discouraged. A tool that cannot name its request
    DTO still cannot be registered; it just has exactly one way to name it now.

    RESOLVABLE IS NOT ENOUGH, so there is a second refusal. A DTO authored FROM the
    wrapper's signature satisfies the intersection by construction and grades nothing -- the
    tool would advertise whatever we wrote, derived from itself. For a tool THE PINNED SDK
    DEFINES, the DTO must therefore inherit the SDK's own request model. The condition is

    automatically the day it is renamed onto its spec operation. The four tools in that
    state today cannot be registered at all: this refusal runs at import, so the tree
