"""The delivery-domain values a webhook conclusion is written from.

Lives above the SSRF seam, not inside it. ``src/core/security/webhook_egress``
owns bytes and destinations -- signing a body, choosing an address, refusing
one. WHO a delivery was for and WHAT became of it are domain facts that the
persistence layer and both senders read, and parking them in the security
package forced ``src/core/database/repositories/delivery.py`` to import out of
``src.core.security`` -- persistence depending on the security package
(salesagent-pldmk.7, review pattern #4 / AR-01).

``WebhookTaskContext``'s own docstring named the bind it was written under: "a
repository importing a dataclass out of a service module would invert the
layering." Both horns were real while the only two homes on offer were the
security package and ``src/services/``. This module is the third: a domain home
that neither side inverts to reach.

Deliberately holds no persistence encoding. ``_OUTCOME_STATUS`` -- the
``kind -> webhook_delivery_log.status`` mapping -- stays in the repository,
because its VALUES ("success", "refused", "failed") are column vocabulary. A
domain module naming DB column values would trade the inversion this move
deletes for one pointing the other way.

    top-level POST body by itself"; :308 makes the envelope a function of the registration
    CHANNEL, and every registration this seller accepts arrives through the AdCP one. So
    there is exactly one body shape, and this is where it is decided.

    It had been decided in two places, and they disagreed:
    ``WebhookDeliveryService.send_delivery_webhook`` posted the flat delivery report --
    the page's own counter-example (:254) -- while ``delivery_webhook_scheduler`` posted
    the envelope, so an in-process test and a live receiver graded different shapes and
    an assertion true of one was vacuous against the other (prebid/salesagent#2058).

    ``task.task_type`` is the INTERNAL label ("delivery_report", "media_buy_delivery"),
    kept for the delivery-log column and the guards that key on it;
    ``validate_webhook_task_type`` coerces the wire value to the pinned ``TaskType`` enum.

    ``operation_id`` and ``token`` come off the REGISTRATION the delivery is going to, and
    both carry echo obligations: core/push-notification-config.json says the seller "MUST
    echo this value verbatim into every webhook payload", and ``operation_id`` is a
    REQUIRED property of the envelope, so omitting it makes the body schema-invalid. The
