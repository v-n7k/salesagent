"""Webhook delivery service with exponential backoff retry logic.

This module provides reliable webhook delivery with:
- Exponential backoff retry strategy (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Database tracking of delivery attempts
- Retry on 5xx errors, no retry on 4xx client errors
- SSRF protection, redirect refusal and the retry schedule: all the egress seam's
- HMAC signing via src.core.security.webhook_egress (spec X-ADCP-Signature)

    three times with substituted variables.

    ``observe_histograms`` preserves today's asymmetry deliberately: only an
    exhausted retry budget observes them, because only it represents a full

    stopped on the first answer; folding either into the latency histogram would
    change what that metric means.
