"""The principal lookups: the resolver's database primitives.

Two readers, one per way a principal is identified. A request identifies its principal
by the token it presents (``get_principal_from_token``); server-initiated work identifies
the owner of a stored row by id (``get_principal_by_id``). Both are scoped to a tenant,
because a principal is a row in exactly one tenant, and both hand back the model built
inside the session so the resolver keeps what was loaded.
