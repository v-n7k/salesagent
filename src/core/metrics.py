"""Prometheus metrics for monitoring AI review and webhook operations.

Label cardinality is deliberately bounded to keep memory flat for a
long-running multi-tenant process:

- **Histograms** never label by ``tenant_id``. Each series allocates a full
  bucket array, so a per-tenant label makes memory grow linearly with the
  tenant count. Latency views stay aggregated; per-tenant *volume* is still
  available on the cheaper Counters.
- **``error_type``** is collapsed to a fixed enum via :func:`categorize_error`
  instead of ``type(e).__name__`` (otherwise unbounded as code evolves, and
  attacker-influenceable).
- **``policy_triggered``** is validated against :data:`POLICY_TRIGGERED_ALLOWLIST`
  via :func:`sanitize_policy_triggered`; unknown values collapse to ``"other"``.

Call sites must record AI-review metrics through :func:`record_ai_review` and
:func:`record_ai_review_error` so the bounding logic lives in exactly one place.
