"""The (domain, brand_id) half of the account natural key, read in ONE place.

The AdCP account natural key is brand.domain + brand.brand_id + operator +
sandbox (BR-RULE-056). Reading its brand half looks trivial and is not:
``BrandReference.brand_id`` is ``BrandId``, a ``RootModel[str]`` that does NOT
override ``__str__``, so ``str(brand.brand_id)`` yields the repr
``"root='brand_one'"`` rather than ``brand_one``.

That is not a cosmetic defect. The mangled text was persisted into
``accounts.brand->>'brand_id'`` and used as the lookup key, while the resolver
read the unmangled value — so the account could never be resolved by its own
key, and because ``JSONType`` validates on read but not on write, the row could
not even be loaded through the ORM afterwards (salesagent-myhs). The cause was
five hand-rolled copies of this extraction disagreeing with each other; this
module exists so there is exactly one.

Leaf by design: it imports nothing from the repository, tool or helper layers,
so the repository (which owns the row) and the request-side callers can both
depend on it without a cycle.

    Accepts both shapes and neither is a fallback: a freshly built row assigns a
    plain dict, while a request payload and a row loaded from the database both
    carry a ``BrandReference``.

    The overloads keep callers that already hold a ``BrandReference`` from having
    to re-narrow ``domain``: it is a required ``str`` on that model, and only the
    dict/None branches can widen it to ``None``.

    The bare-string branch is covered here so this helper is TOTAL over the
    same union the request models declare -- without it, every caller reading a domain off
    a request field had to narrow the union itself, and four of them simply wrote
    ``request.brand.domain`` and were wrong on two of the three branches.
