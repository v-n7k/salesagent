"""Translate both egress seams' failures into this application's AdCP taxonomy.

``src/core/security/outbound_http.py`` deliberately raises exactly two errors:
``OutboundRequestBlocked`` (refused before connecting) and
``OutboundDeliveryFailed`` (reached the network, did not deliver). That is its
whole public failure surface, and it stays that way — the seam must not learn
which AdCP code a given caller wants a 429 to become, because the answer depends
on whose URL it is and what the caller is doing with it. The guarded MCP seam
(``src.core.utils.mcp_client.call_mcp_tool``) has its own failure surface —
``MCPConnectionError`` / ``MCPCompatibilityError`` — for the same underlying
reason: closing the SSRF gap ``adcp.ADCPMultiAgentClient`` left (no transport
injection point in adcp 6.6.0 — upstream adcp-client-python#1004) meant routing
through a different transport with a different exception vocabulary.

The translation still has to live in ONE place per DECISION, or every migrating
call site re-derives it and they drift — which is the duplication this module
exists to delete. So both seams' mappers live here: a leaf module importing
only the seams and the exception taxonomy. Both extract (status, retry_after)
from their own failure surface and delegate the CLASS decision to
:func:`adcp_error_for_status` — the one function under this file (and this
codebase) that maps an HTTP status to an AdCP error class. They differ only in
what they can attach to the result: ``raise_mapped_outbound_error`` re-raises
its own ``OutboundDeliveryFailed`` for the 5xx/no-status case (preserving
``attempts``/``last_status``, which the classifier has no object to carry);
``raise_mapped_mcp_error`` has no such object and keeps the classifier's
freshly-built one. One explanatory asymmetry, not a third behavior.

NOT in ``src/core/helpers/adapter_helpers.py``. That module imports the
ad-server adapters at module level, and the adapters are precisely the call
sites that will use this mapper as the epic's remaining migrations land —
importing it back would be a cycle. (Its former sibling ``raise_mapped_adcp_error``,
for the adcp SDK's own exception hierarchy, is gone: both callers moved off
``ADCPMultiAgentClient`` onto the guarded MCP seam in salesagent-4n88, and the function
itself outlived that move by a release -- this sentence described it as deleted while it
was still in the tree with zero callers, which is how it kept a dict ``details`` raise
site alive in a module nothing imported.)

``MCPConnectionError`` looked, at first read, like it discarded the HTTP status
entirely. It does not, except for one case: the MCP Streamable HTTP transport
(``mcp/client/streamable_http.py::_handle_post_request``) special-cases a plain
404 on a session POST as "no such session" — a PROTOCOL-level signal, not a
transport failure — and synthesizes an opaque ``McpError`` for it, discarding
the status on purpose. Every other non-2xx status is a normal
``httpx.HTTPStatusError`` that survives intact as ``__cause__`` (status code and
headers, including ``Retry-After``, fully readable), because
``raise ... from ...`` chaining is exactly what both ``MCPConnectionError`` and
``call_mcp_tool``'s retry loop use. Only used for OPERATOR-configured agents —
a counterparty-supplied ``agent_url`` never reaches ``raise_mapped_mcp_error``
(``creative_agent_registry.py`` routes those through ``_fetch_formats_raw_mcp``,
on the raw egress seam's own ``OutboundError`` taxonomy, unchanged by this
migration).

Spec grounding for the classification (AdCP 3.1.1,
``dist/schemas/3.1.1/enums/error-code.json`` enumMetadata):

* ``CONFIGURATION_ERROR`` — recovery ``terminal``, "surface to a human at the
  seller — the buyer cannot resolve a seller-side deployment misconfiguration and
  MUST NOT auto-retry". That is exactly a refused OPERATOR-registered endpoint.
* ``RATE_LIMITED`` — recovery ``transient``, "retry after the retry_after
  interval".
* ``SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`` — recovery ``transient``.

    of the retryable-status set is needed to exclude it — the drift #1802's F2
    finding documented, where an inline ``400 <= status < 500`` was only correct
    because 429 happened to be checked first, in TWO places that could drift
    independently); ``status is None`` (a transport failure, never reached the
    wire) and any other status (a 5xx) -> ``SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE``.

    here keeps a future violation loud instead of silently misclassifying, and
    avoids inventing a CounterpartyUrl status taxonomy neither caller nor any
    RED grader exercises.

    BUILDS the error and returns it; it does not raise. A classifier that
    raised could only be consulted by CATCHING it, which is why both mappers
    used to wrap the call in a ``try`` and re-``raise`` from three ``except``
    branches apiece just to attach one log line. Returning the value lets each
    mapper branch on it directly and decide what to log and what to raise.

    Deliberately takes no ``logger``/original exception: logging is each
    mapper's own concern (the wording differs per seam) and stays at the call
    site, which is also where the chaining decision belongs.
