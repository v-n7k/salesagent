"""Creative Agent Registry for dynamic format discovery per AdCP v2.4.

This module provides:
1. Creative agent registry (system defaults + tenant-specific)
2. Dynamic format discovery via MCP
3. Format caching (in-memory with TTL)
4. Multi-agent support for DCO platforms, custom creative agents

Architecture:
- Default agent: https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org (always available)
- Tenant agents: Configured in creative_agents database table
- Format resolution: Query agents via MCP, cache results
- Preview generation: Delegate to creative agent
- Generative creative: Use agent's create_generative_creative tool

Testing:
- When ADCP_TESTING=true, returns mock formats instead of calling external services
- This avoids timeouts in CI when external creative agents are unreachable
