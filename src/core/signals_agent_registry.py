"""Signals Agent Registry for upstream signals discovery integration.

This module provides:
1. Signals agent registry (tenant-specific agents)
2. Dynamic signals discovery via AdCP library
3. Multi-agent support for different signals providers

Architecture:
- No default agent (tenant-specific only)
- Tenant agents: Configured in signals_agents database table
- Signals resolution: Query agents via adcp library, handle responses

Schema Version: AdCP v2.2.0
- Uses signal_spec (not brief from v1)
- Uses deliver_to.platforms as array of strings ["all"] (not single string "all")
- Supports custom auth headers via auth_header parameter

Security:
- Auth credentials stored in database (tenant-specific)
- Custom auth headers supported (e.g., Authorization, x-api-key)
- Bearer token format: "Bearer {token}"
- Token format: "{token}"

Migration Note: Now uses official `adcp` library (v1.0.1) instead of custom MCP client.
- ~100 lines of custom code replaced with official library
- Custom auth headers now fully supported (was critical blocker)
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing API
