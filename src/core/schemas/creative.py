#: IPTC Digital Source Type, for AI provenance under EU AI Act Article 50.
#:
#: THE PINNED ENUM ITSELF, not a local copy of it. This was a hand-written ``StrEnum``
#: duplicating the vocabulary, and it had DRIFTED: it still carried
#: ``composite_with_trained_model``, ``trained_algorithmic_model`` and
#: ``minor_human_edits``, while the pin renamed the first two to
#: ``composite_with_trained_algorithmic_media`` / ``trained_algorithmic_media``, dropped
#: the third, and added ``data_driven_media``.
#:
#: The drift was not cosmetic. ``Provenance.digital_source_type`` is typed with the
#: LIBRARY enum, so every renamed member of the local copy was REFUSED by the very model
#: it existed to populate — constructing a Provenance with one raised ValidationError.
#: Nothing in ``src/`` used it (measured: one definition, zero other references), so the
#: breakage lived only in tests, which is why it survived.
#:
#: An alias rather than a subclass because Python forbids extending an enum that has
#: members — the same constraint ``library_base_violation`` had to be taught in
#: ``tests/unit/test_architecture_schema_inheritance.py``. CLAUDE.md Pattern #1: use the
#: library type, never duplicate it.
DigitalSourceType = LibraryDigitalSourceType


#: AI provenance metadata for creative assets: the pinned ``core/provenance.json``, used
#: directly. Tracks the origin, AI involvement and disclosure status of creative content
#: per EU AI Act Article 50 (enforcement Aug 2026). The sales agent is pass-through -- it
#: stores and forwards what buyers and creative agents declare, it does not generate it.
#:
#: An ALIAS rather than a subclass, for the same reason as ``DigitalSourceType`` above:
#: there is nothing local to add. The subclass this replaces had a docstring and no body --
#: identical field set, identical annotations, identical config, zero validators of its
#: own -- so it conformed by inheritance and then existed only to be a DIFFERENT CLASS.
#:
#: That difference had a cost. Pydantic validates a model-typed slot by instance, and the
#: one real arrival path (``src/core/tools/creatives/_validation.py``, which reads
#: ``provenance`` off a ``CreativeAssetRequest`` and hands it to ``Creative``) delivers the
#: LIBRARY class, so the subclass REFUSED the very object it was there to carry. A
#: ``mode="before"`` validator existed purely to rebuild one from the other's attributes.
#: Deleting the subclass deletes the cause, and the validator went with it.
#:
#: What the earlier hand-written version got wrong is recorded here because the pin is the
#: only place that shape is now stated: it declared eight of the pin's twelve fields --
#: missing ``declared_at``, ``embedded_provenance``, ``watermarks`` and ``ext`` entirely --
#: and typed four of the eight as scalars where the pin declares objects (``c2pa``,
#: ``disclosure``, ``declared_by``, ``human_oversight``), with ``verification`` a list of
#: them rather than a free dict. It also wrapped a plain string ``ai_tool`` as
#: ``AiTool(name=...)``, a tolerance the pin does not grant. Using the pinned class is what
#: makes all of that unrepeatable.

    Deliberately NOT ``Creative`` below, which extends the list_creatives RESPONSE model.
    This field used to point there, so the request shape was a response shape. Once MCP and
    REST both derived their accepted shape from this DTO, that became enforced on both, and
    it cost real capability:

      * seven SPEC-LEGAL request fields could not be sent -- inputs, format_kind,
        format_option_ref, weight, placement_refs, placement_ids, industry_identifiers.
        ``inputs`` is IMPLEMENTED (tools/creatives/_assets.py reads inputs[0].
        context_description as the generative prompt fallback), so a shipped feature was
        unreachable on two of three transports.
      * ``assets`` is spec-REQUIRED and the response model made it optional, so a payload
        omitting it cleared the boundary and failed late and differently per transport:
        mid-pipeline VALIDATION_ERROR on mcp/rest, silently defaulted to {} on a2a.

    The old docstring called the response model "richer". It is -- in RESPONSE fields, while
    missing REQUEST ones, which is the whole defect in one word.

    THE ONEOF, FLATTENED. core/creative-asset.json identifies a creative by ``format_id`` OR
    by ``format_kind``. The SDK models that: datamodel-codegen renders two classes with
    identical field sets, differing only in which identifier each requires (CreativeAsset1,
    CreativeAsset2), wrapped in a RootModel union. Pydantic's union validation of that type
    IS the oneOf, so re-implementing it would normally be the mistake.

    One thing rules it out, and it is a wire-contract reason rather than a taste one. A
    failing union branch carries its own class name in the pydantic ``loc``, so the buyer
    receives the pointer ``/creatives/0/CreativeAsset1/name``. ``core/error.json`` requires
    ``issues[].pointer`` to address the offending field IN THE REQUEST PAYLOAD, and
    ``CreativeAsset1`` names nothing the buyer sent: it is a codegen artifact that appears
    nowhere in AdCP. The SDK validates correctly and reports the failure unconformantly.
    NOT yet reported upstream -- searched adcontextprotocol/adcp and found no issue for it.

    Flattening onto one branch -- which already carries every field of both -- keeps the
    validation and fixes the pointer. ``format_id`` relaxes to optional, the constraint
    states itself as the ``oneOf`` keyword, and the pointer stays ``/creatives/0``. Extend
    the union type instead on the day its locs address the payload.

    # caller holding a typed SDK object would have to know about our subclass and

    # LibraryFormatId, not the local FormatId subclass: the ONLY axis this redeclaration

    adcp 3.9: SyncCreativesResponse is now a union TypeAlias (not RootModel).
    Since the error variant is never constructed (ToolError handles failures),
    we subclass the success variant directly.

    ``ProtocolEnvelope`` IS INHERITED HERE AS A LOCAL WORKAROUND, and it should not have to
    be. ``creative/sync-creatives-response.json`` composes the envelope into the whole
    response with ``allOf``, so every branch carries its eleven fields -- but the SDK's generated
    ``SyncCreativesResponse1`` (this class's parent) inherits ``AdcpVersionEnvelope`` alone.
    At adcp 6.6 that is true of 19 of the 24 ``*SuccessResponse`` aliases: the five that DO
    inherit are the ones whose response schema has no ``oneOf``, so the alias resolves to the
    root class and picks the base up from the root ``allOf``. Filed upstream as
    adcontextprotocol/adcp-client-python#1136.

    Without this base, nine of the eleven envelope fields are untyped here and reach the wire
    only as pydantic extras -- ``replayed`` among them, which is why a replayed sync used to
    go out with no marker at all. Delete this base the day the SDK's success branches compose the
    envelope; ``ProtocolEnvelope`` is exported and correct, only the branches fail to inherit it.

    adcp 6.6 restored the fields SDK 5.7 had collapsed off the success envelope:
    dry_run, context (ContextObject|None) and ext (ExtensionObject|None) are all
    INHERITED from the parent again (identical definitions; production may assign
    raw dicts to context/ext, which Pydantic coerces on validation). Only
    ``creatives`` remains overridden — see below.
