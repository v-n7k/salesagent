    """Advisory error whose graded fields are FUNCTIONS OF ``code``, not inputs.

    The SDK types ``code`` as ``str`` — correctly, because AdCP 3.1.1 makes the
    error-code vocabulary open. That openness is a wire contract, not a licence
    for this seller to emit a code it never defined. Narrowing the field here
    makes an out-of-vocabulary advisory unconstructible, at every site, whatever
    local name the type is imported under — which an AST guard cannot do, because
    an import alias defeats it.

    ``message``, ``suggestion`` and ``recovery`` are DERIVED from ``CODE_TABLE``
    at validation (ADR-010: a graded wire field is a function of the code, never
    authored at a raise site). Anything a caller passes for those three is
    discarded, so the advisory lane and the raised lane resolve one code to one
    sentence — they previously did not, because the normalizer this replaces
    filled ``recovery``/``suggestion`` only when the caller left them unset and
    never touched ``message`` at all.

    Every other field — ``field``, ``details``, ``retry_after``, ``issues``,
    ``source``, ``sdk_id`` — passes through untouched: they carry the specifics,
    which is exactly where specifics belong.

    The four overrides below exist because ``frozen=True`` alone does NOT close
    this. Measured against pydantic 2.12.5, five separate routes overwrite a
    derived field, and ``frozen`` stops only direct assignment:

        model_copy(update=...)   __replace__(...)   model_construct(...)
        setattr                  __dict__ poke

    ``validate_assignment`` does not help either — it re-runs FIELD validators,
    not this ``mode="before"`` MODEL validator. So each mutating entry point is
    redefined as a RE-VALIDATION: a copy re-derives from the table rather than
    poking a field, which also means ``model_copy(update={"code": X})`` correctly
    yields X's message rather than carrying the old one. This is what makes the
    defect unconstructible instead of merely detectable; the alternative
    considered was an AST guard banning ``model_copy``, which would have covered
    one of the five routes and could never have fired on ``AdCPSalesAgentError`` at all
    (it is not a pydantic model).

    ``docs/reference/url-canonicalization``: lowercased scheme and host, IDN hosts
    to Punycode, userinfo stripped, default ports dropped, dot segments removed but
    consecutive slashes PRESERVED, percent-encoding normalized, query preserved
    byte-for-byte, fragment stripped. This is the single canonical form used both to
    compare two FormatId references for federation identity (see
    ``format_id_identity``) and to key the creative-agent format cache
    (``CreativeAgentRegistry._cache_key``).

    The algorithm is not reimplemented here. It comes from
    ``src.vendor.adcp_canonical`` — adcp 7.0.2's implementation, copied verbatim,
    which passes all 37 published conformance vectors. The version this repo pins
    (6.6.0) fails 14 of them and is terminal on its line; that package's docstring
    has the detail, and salesagent-3xcdk deletes it by migrating.

    **Spec step 5 is applied here, not there.** "If the path is empty AND an
    authority is present, substitute ``/``." 7.0.2 does this only when a query is
    present (``https://h.com?x=1`` -> ``https://h.com/?x=1``) and leaves
    ``https://h.com`` with an empty path; no conformance vector covers the no-query
    case, so it passes 37/37 while still diverging. Applying it makes
    ``https://x.org`` and ``https://x.org/`` one agent, which is the spelling
    difference a human actually produces.

    What this deliberately does NOT do is ``.rstrip("/")``, which it used to. That
    is an "additional transformation before comparison", which the algorithm's
    closing sentence forbids, and it went further than step 5 in three ways the
    spec calls DISTINCT: it equated ``/a`` with ``/a/``, equated
    ``/.well-known/adcp/sales`` with ``.../sales/``, and collapsed the consecutive
    slashes step 5 exists to preserve.

    comparison key built any other way is wrong -- but when the key was a bare tuple
    nothing could say so, because a hand-built tuple has the identical static type and
    differs only in VALUE. ``mypy.ini`` already sets ``strict_equality = True`` and it
    does not help there: comparing a raw ``tuple[str, str]`` against a
    ``set[tuple[str, str]]`` type-checks clean.

    It does help here. Against a ``set[FormatIdentity]`` the same mistake is
    ``Non-overlapping container check ... [comparison-overlap]`` at type-check time,
    so the rule is REFUSED rather than merely documented.

    This is not hypothetical. A UC-005 BDD scenario compared
    ``(SELLER_AGENT_URL, fid.id)`` -- the raw constant, un-canonicalized -- against a
    set of identities, and that assertion was the only one separating ``(agent_url,

    # adcp 6.6 (spec 3.1.1) made these required on the success envelope. ``status`` is
    # REQUIRED and typed ``Literal["completed"]`` by the SDK parent, because this is the
    # success branch and the branch's schema makes the value a const. A local
    # ``CompletedTaskStatusMixin`` used to declare that field and supply its default; it is
    # deleted, and nothing replaced it, because the SDK parent already does both jobs — its
    # own ``_normalize_legacy_status`` before-validator fills ``"completed"`` when a caller
    # omits the field. Listing ``ProtocolEnvelope`` AFTER the parent is deliberate: the
    # parent's narrower ``Literal`` wins, so ``status="failed"`` on a success branch stays a
    # type error rather than becoming an eight-member enum.
    # ``confirmed_at`` and ``revision`` are NOT invariant: they are columns the repository
    # owns, so they carry NO default here and every construction site states where its
    # value came from. A default made this model a second producer of persisted state —
    # and an invisible one, because the write-seam guard scans assignments and a
    # ``default_factory`` is not an assignment.
    #
    # What the default asserted: ``confirmed_at=datetime.now(UTC)`` on EVERY success,
    # including a ``pending_creatives`` buy whose column is NULL precisely because the
    # seller has not committed. The docstring of ``CreateMediaBuySubmitted`` below
    # already rejects that reasoning in so many words ("would falsely assert the seller
    # confirmed a buy that is not yet committed"); the Success branch was doing it.
    #
    # Both keep the parent's REQUIRED types and lose only their local defaults, so
    # omitting either is a construction error instead of a fabricated value.

    # WIDENED to ``| None``, and the whole stack already agreed except this line:

    #   pin  create-media-buy-response.json @ 3.1.1 branch0 (CreateMediaBuySuccess)
    #        type ["string", "null"], and IN ``required`` -> present, may be null
    #   ORM  MediaBuy.confirmed_at  Mapped[datetime | None], nullable=True
    #   DB   media_buys.confirmed_at  is_nullable = YES
    #
    # So this annotation was the only layer narrower than the contract, and the
    # narrowing was never mandated. ``required`` + nullable is exactly "the key must
    # be present, its value may be null" -- no default, and AlwaysIncludeFieldsMixin
    # emits the explicit null rather than dropping the key.
    #
    # It previously said "deliberately NOT widened", on the premise that "this seller
    # never [sends null]: ... a create that is NOT committed (manual approval pending)
    # returns the ``CreateMediaBuySubmitted`` branch instead." That premise was false for
    # one path, and review found it: a ``pending_creatives`` create returns the
    # SUCCESS branch, not Submitted. While PENDING_CREATIVES sat in
    # ``_SELLER_COMMITTED_STATUSES`` the buy got stamped and the non-null type held --
    # but the stamp itself was the defect, a write-once buyer-visible commitment minted
    # at the moment of a HOLD, before the ad server was contacted. Removing that
    # membership is the fix; this widening is what makes the correct state expressible.
    #
    # The suppression records an SDK/SPEC DIVERGENCE, not our convenience: we extend the
    # SDK's class, and that class does not account for the null case its own pinned
    # schema permits. Suppressing here is how we keep inheriting the SDK type while
    # honouring the contract it under-specifies. Cost stated rather than buried -- the
    # type-ignore ratchet moves 56 -> 57, and the ratchet is shrink-only by default, so
    # this is an approved exception rather than a silent increase.

    # underivable by design because the root composes through oneOf.
    #
    # Adopting the mixin is not optional once confirmed_at can be null: the library
    # base serializes with exclude_none=True, so a null value DROPS the key -- and the
    # pin lists confirmed_at in `required`, so a document missing it fails validation.
    # That is the same silent-omission class as GH #1900, which is why this PR exists.
