# adcp 6.6 ships its model tree with deferred pydantic-core builds (forward refs unresolved
# at class creation), so shared leaf types (ReportingPeriod, PushNotificationConfig,
# ExtensionObject, ...) stay ``__pydantic_complete__ is False`` with a ``MockValSer`` serializer
# until something validates them as a *top-level* target. Pydantic only auto-heals a model
# used as a top-level target — a model used only as a *nested field* keeps its mock serializer,
# and our wrap serializers hand off to it during dump -> "'MockValSer' object cannot be
# converted to 'SchemaSerializer'". Order-dependent: a model passes iff an earlier test/import
# happened to validate its leaf types first.
#
# Fix: honor pydantic's contract by completing the transitive CLOSURE of model types reachable
# from the schemas we serialize, once, now that every referenced type is importable. This is
# deterministic and targeted — it walks only types our models reference, not the thousands of
# unused adcp submodels.
