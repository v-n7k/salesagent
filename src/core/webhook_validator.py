"""Webhook URL validation to prevent SSRF attacks.

This module provides security validation for webhook URLs to prevent
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks where malicious users could
trick the server into making requests to internal services.

Relationship to ``src/core/security/outbound_http.py``: that module is the seam
every outbound *request* goes through, and it owns SEND-time policy outright —
address, TLS, redirect and retry, delegated to the adcp SDK. This module keeps
exactly ONE gate, and only because the seam cannot yet express it: registration.

Both of the seam's pre-connection entry points (``send``/``asend`` and
``validate_url``) go through ``adcp.signing.resolve_and_validate_host``, which
ALWAYS resolves DNS. Registration is deliberately a no-DNS verdict — an
unresolvable but public hostname must be ACCEPTED at registration and re-checked
with DNS when the callback is actually dialled. ``WebhookURLValidator.
validate_webhook_url_registration`` below is now a thin ``(bool, str)`` wrapper
over :meth:`~src.core.security.egress.policy.EgressPolicy.check_registration` —
the shared address predicate both verdicts read now lives in
``src/core/security/egress/policy.py``, and ``src/core/security/
url_validator.py`` (this module's former SSRF-computation dependency) has been
deleted; nothing under ``src/`` computes address policy outside the egress
package.

There is no send-side gate here any more. There used to be
(``validate_outbound_webhook_url`` and friends); it had no production callers and
survived only as a patch target that made test controls look live while
intercepting nothing, so it was deleted. Any new outbound send goes through the
seam — never a second copy of address policy here.

The one thing this gate MUST NOT decide for itself is the scheme. That decision
belongs to :class:`~src.core.security.egress.policy.EgressPolicy`, which
requires https unconditionally on both verdicts (salesagent-e6h0 deleted the
send-side escape hatch). An ingest gate that admitted a scheme the seam refuses
would accept a buyer's webhook URL with a success envelope and then never
deliver to it, which is the one failure mode the buyer cannot see or correct.

``validate_webhook_task_type`` below is an unrelated concern (SDK payload enum
coercion) that happens to live in this file.
