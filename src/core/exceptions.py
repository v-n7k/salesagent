"""AdCP exception hierarchy for typed error handling across transport layers.

Business logic raises these exceptions. Transport layers (A2A, MCP, REST)

Exception classes define the error vocabulary — transport layers format them.
Each exception carries a recovery classification (transient/correctable/terminal)

# -- one transcription of the wire schema's three values, not two. The parallel

# same closed set, bridged to the enum by unchecked casts; it is deleted so the
# two cannot disagree.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Error codes on the wire
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# There is ONE classifier: ``CODE_TABLE`` in src/core/errors/codes.py, loaded from
# the pinned enums/error-code.json (92 published codes) plus this platform's own
# ``AppErrorCode`` members. Message, recovery, suggestion and status all come
# from that file. The SDK's ``STANDARD_ERROR_CODES`` is consulted for NONE of
# them: it was the message fallback until it was measured to shadow published
# text for 37 of the 92 codes while adding nothing for the other 55, so it is
# now only a cross-check a reader may consult, never an input.
#
# Every code a raise site declares reaches the buyer VERBATIM: the AdCP error
# vocabulary is OPEN, so there is no translation at the transport boundary and no
# server-only set. Message, recovery and suggestion are all functions of the code
# (see docs/decisions/adr-010-graded-wire-fields-are-functions-of-the-code.md), so a
# raise site cannot make one of them disagree with the pin.
#
# That openness is the PIN's own words, not this module's preference. AdCP 3.1.1
# ``core/error.json`` types ``error.code`` as a bare ``string`` (minLength 1,
# maxLength 64) and states: "the standard codes published in
# ``enums/error-code.json`` are documentary, and senders MAY emit codes outside
# that set ... Receivers MUST decode unknown codes — treat the response as
# well-formed, read ``error.recovery`` for the recovery classification".
#
# Reconciliation note (merge of origin/main's #1858 storyboard-conformance work).
# origin/main answered the same problem with a different apparatus, all of which
# ``CODE_TABLE`` SUBSUMES, so none of it is carried here:
#
#   * ``RECOVERY_BY_WIRE_CODE`` / ``_load_pinned_recovery()`` — read ``recovery``
#     out of the pinned ``enums/error-code.json`` ``enumMetadata``. ``CODE_TABLE``
#     reads the same normative block of the same file and carries recovery
#     ALONGSIDE suggestion, message and status, so re-adding it would be a second
#     load of one file answering a question this one already answers.
#   * ``_SPEC_SUPPLEMENT_CODES`` (CREATIVE_NOT_FOUND, CONFIGURATION_ERROR) and
#     ``_SPEC_DEMOTED_CODES`` (NOT_SUPPORTED) — both existed to reconcile the SDK
#     helper's 38-code list against the pin. Loading the pin directly makes the
#     reconciliation unnecessary: the table classifies the two supplements and does
#     not contain the demoted one.
#   * ``WIRE_STANDARD_CODES`` / ``INTERNAL_CODES`` / ``ERROR_CODE_MAPPING`` /
#     ``translate_error_code`` / ``to_wire_error_code`` — a closed wire set plus a
#     boundary translator. The pin quoted above forbids the premise: a code outside
#     the published 92 is legal, and a receiver is REQUIRED to decode it from
#     ``recovery``. Collapsing MEDIA_BUY_REJECTED to POLICY_VIOLATION destroyed
#     information the spec says the buyer may consume.
#   * ``wire_advisory()`` — the one constructor for an ``errors[]`` advisory, which
#     derived recovery from the pin. ``AdcpErrorResponse.of`` derives recovery AND
#     message AND suggestion from the same pin, and takes the typed exception rather
#     than a loose (code, message) pair, so a code and its details cannot be paired
#     wrongly at the call site.
#
# What DID come across from origin/main, because nothing here subsumed it:
# ``RETRY_AFTER_MAX`` / :func:`clamp_retry_after` below, and the two-families
# reading of :class:`AdCPConfigurationError`.


# The pinned spec bounds retry_after: AdCP 3.1.1 ``core/error.json`` →
# ``retry_after`` is ``{"type": "number", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 3600}`` and its
# description reads "Sellers MUST return values between 1 and 3600. Clients MUST
# clamp values outside this range." Never emit more even when the underlying wait
# is longer. A spec constant, not an operational knob — deliberately not
# env-tunable.

    Parameterized on the detail shape it carries. Parameterizing rather than
    overriding ``__init__`` on each of the 32 error classes that carry details
    is what keeps the narrowing free of boilerplate: one ``__init__`` signature
    here, typed ``DetailsT | None``, gives every subclass its own exact detail
    type. mypy then rejects both a dict and a foreign detail class at every
    raise site, and reading ``exc.details`` back is typed without a cast.

    Class-level identity is ``_code`` and nothing else, declared with
    ``ClassVar`` per PEP 526. The public ``error_code``, ``message``,
    ``recovery``, ``suggestion`` and ``status_code`` are read-only properties
    over ``_error_code`` — functions of the code, resolved from
    ``CODE_TABLE`` at every read, so no instance can carry a value that
    disagrees with the table by any route, assignment included.

    ``status_code`` joined that list in salesagent-pssfi. It used to be a
    per-class ``_default_status_code`` slot, which let a class redeclare its
    ``_code`` and keep a status inherited from a parent that meant something
    else — ``SimulationError`` emitted INVALID_REQUEST with
    ``AdCPNotFoundError``'s 404 — and forced the plain-``ToolError`` boundary to
    reconstruct a code → status table by walking ``__subclasses__()``, whose
    answer for INVALID_REQUEST was 400 or 404 depending on the import set. There
    is now no per-class slot to disagree with, and nothing to walk.

    Code that needs class-level identity reads ``cls._code`` directly. Instance
    code reads ``self.error_code`` etc. as before.

    Attributes:
        message: Human-readable error description (read-only, from CODE_TABLE).
        status_code: HTTP status for REST/FastAPI responses (read-only, from
            CODE_TABLE).
        error_code: Machine-readable error code string (read-only).
        recovery: Recovery classification for buyer agents (read-only, from
            CODE_TABLE).
        details: Optional structured error details.
        field: Optional field name that caused the error.
        suggestion: Correction hint for buyer agents (read-only, from
            CODE_TABLE).
        internal_detail: Optional NON-WIRE cause — the caught exception that
            produced this error (ADR-010 point 5). NEVER serialized:
            ``AdcpErrorResponse.of`` ignores it; the boundary logs it with its
            traceback. An authored sentence here says nothing the code, the class
            and the typed details do not already say; every raise site passes the
            exception it caught, or nothing.
            See the class note below.

    Message provenance (AdCP 3.1.1 ``transport-errors.mdx`` § Security
    Considerations / Seller Requirements, lines 659-670): "Error responses
    flow through LLM context. Every field is client-facing. Implementations
    MUST NOT include: internal service names, hostnames, or IP addresses;
    database error text …; stack traces or file paths; upstream API responses
    from internal services; credentials, tokens, or session identifiers."

    ``adcp_error_for()`` returns an already-typed ``AdCPSalesAgentError``
    unchanged, so for a typed error THE RAISE SITE IS THE WIRE — there is no
    downstream sanitization point. That is why ``message`` is no longer
    authored at all: it is a read-only property returning
    ``CODE_TABLE[code].message``, and ``__init__`` takes no ``message``
    parameter, so the prohibited categories above cannot be interpolated into
    buyer-facing text even by accident. The trust decision is made once, in the
    table, instead of per raise site.

    Where the spec POSITIVELY requires request-specific content — version
    negotiation must name the buyer's requested version and the seller's
    supported set — that content goes in ``details``, which is exactly where
    the spec reads it from: see ``AdCPVersionUnsupportedError`` below, whose
    recovery is "re-pin to a release in the returned
    ``error.details.supported_versions``". Structured values in ``details``,
    the caught exception in ``internal_detail`` and on the ``from`` chain (written
    once to the server log by the boundary's ``record_boundary_error``, never
    emitted), and nothing at all in ``message``.

    Emits the PUBLISHED ``VALIDATION_ERROR``, not a platform code. This class briefly
    carried a minted ``URL_NOT_ALLOWED`` on the reasoning that VALIDATION_ERROR "tells a
    buyer nothing they can act on differently". That reasoning does not survive the pin:
    malformed-vs-value-refused is already the published INVALID_REQUEST / VALIDATION_ERROR
    split (INVALID_REQUEST is "malformed, missing required fields, or violates schema
    constraints"; VALIDATION_ERROR is "invalid field values or violates business rules
    beyond schema validation"), and a schema-valid https URI refused by a deny-list is the
    second. The pinned spec then applies it to this exact vector:
    ``dist/docs/3.1.0/learning/specialist/security.mdx:84`` has the practitioner register
    ``https://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`` and "observe that the agent refuses it
    synchronously with a ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` on ``notification_configs[].url``".

    The open vocabulary permits minting a code the spec has NOT defined; it does not make
    a private synonym of a published member a good idea, because a buyer switching on
    ``error.code`` across sellers loses the ability to handle this uniformly.

    The class survives the code change on purpose: the A2A boundary catches it BY TYPE to
    select ``InvalidParamsError``, which a bare ``AdCPValidationError`` could not express
    without also catching every other validation failure. Being a SUBCLASS costs nothing
    there — ``isinstance`` still discriminates the URL refusal exactly.

    It is a subclass rather than a sibling because two fail-closed handlers depend on the
    subsumption, and both are load-bearing rather than incidental:
    ``src/services/delivery_webhook_scheduler.py`` and ``src/core/context_manager.py`` each
    wrap the registration gate (``webhooks/registration.py`` →
    ``reject_unsafe_webhook_registration_url``) in ``except AdCPValidationError`` precisely
    so a refused registration becomes a logged non-delivery instead of an exception that
    kills the scheduler loop or fails a status transition. As a direct
    ``AdCPSalesAgentError`` subclass — which is how this branch declared it — an SSRF
    refusal escapes both. The parent's ``ValidationDetails`` replaces the
    ``ValueRejectionDetails`` this class was parameterized on; no raise site in the tree
    passes ``details=`` to it, so that parameter was carrying nothing.

    The buyer's actionable signal is the CODE plus ``field`` (which URL was refused). The
    rejection REASON never reaches the buyer -- the spec's Security Considerations forbid
    disclosing internal service names, hostnames or IP addresses, so the cause rides
    ``internal_detail`` (server log only). Deliberate loss in the switch: the retired
    entry's suggestion enumerated the refused host classes, where VALIDATION_ERROR's is
    the generic "review error details and fix field values". A per-class override is NOT
    the fix -- it would make the suggestion a function of the class rather than the code,
    which ADR-010 forbids (the override knob that once allowed it is deleted).

    logic across fourteen tools calls services that call services, and a caller that forgets to

    WHY IT CARRIES A RESPONSE. The thing a transport must write is a response --
    ``core/protocol-envelope.json`` declares ``adcp_error``, ``context`` and a required
    ``status`` on every response envelope -- so a transport handed a bare exception has to
    build one, and three of them did, from a hand-assembled dict that could carry no ``status``.
    Carrying the response means the conversion happens once, where the request's ``context`` is

# and both branches already resolved a refused URL to the same published
# VALIDATION_ERROR — "invalid field values or violates business rules beyond

# schema constraints". A schema-valid https URI refused by a deny-list is the
# former. So the spec distinguishes nothing here for a second class to carry, and
# there is one class with one alias.
#
# The surviving class takes origin/main's HIERARCHY (subclass of
# AdCPValidationError) and this branch's NAME and body — see the class docstring
# for why the hierarchy half is a behavior fix rather than a preference.
# origin/main's other difference, an authored ``_default_message`` ("URL resolves
# to a restricted range."), is subsumed: the message here is the code's own table
# sentence, which is the ADR-010 rule the whole taxonomy follows and which keeps
# the refused host out of buyer-facing text by construction.
