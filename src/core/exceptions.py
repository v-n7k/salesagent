# -- one transcription of the wire schema's three values, not two. The parallel
# ``RecoveryHint`` Literal this module used to declare was a second copy of the
# same closed set, bridged to the enum by unchecked casts; it is deleted so the
# two cannot disagree.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Error codes on the wire
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# There is ONE classifier: ``CODE_TABLE`` in src/core/errors/codes.py, loaded from
# the pinned enums/error-code.json (92 published codes) plus this platform's own
# ``AppErrorCode`` members. Message, recovery, suggestion and status all come
# from that file. The SDK's ``STANDARD_ERROR_CODES`` is consulted for NONE of
# them: it was the message fallback until it was measured to shadow published
# text for 37 of the 92 codes while adding nothing for the other 55, so it is
# now only a cross-check a reader may consult, never an input.
#
# Every code a raise site declares reaches the buyer VERBATIM: the AdCP error
# vocabulary is OPEN, so there is no translation at the transport boundary and no
# server-only set. Message, recovery and suggestion are all functions of the code
# (see docs/decisions/adr-010-graded-wire-fields-are-functions-of-the-code.md), so a
# raise site cannot make one of them disagree with the pin.
#
# That openness is the PIN's own words, not this module's preference. AdCP 3.1.1
# ``core/error.json`` types ``error.code`` as a bare ``string`` (minLength 1,
# maxLength 64) and states: "the standard codes published in
# ``enums/error-code.json`` are documentary, and senders MAY emit codes outside
# that set ... Receivers MUST decode unknown codes — treat the response as
# well-formed, read ``error.recovery`` for the recovery classification".
#
# Reconciliation note (merge of origin/main's #1858 storyboard-conformance work).
# origin/main answered the same problem with a different apparatus, all of which
# ``CODE_TABLE`` SUBSUMES, so none of it is carried here:
#
#   * ``RECOVERY_BY_WIRE_CODE`` / ``_load_pinned_recovery()`` — read ``recovery``
#     out of the pinned ``enums/error-code.json`` ``enumMetadata``. ``CODE_TABLE``
#     reads the same normative block of the same file and carries recovery
#     ALONGSIDE suggestion, message and status, so re-adding it would be a second
#     load of one file answering a question this one already answers.
#   * ``_SPEC_SUPPLEMENT_CODES`` (CREATIVE_NOT_FOUND, CONFIGURATION_ERROR) and
#     ``_SPEC_DEMOTED_CODES`` (NOT_SUPPORTED) — both existed to reconcile the SDK
#     helper's 38-code list against the pin. Loading the pin directly makes the
#     reconciliation unnecessary: the table classifies the two supplements and does
#     not contain the demoted one.
#   * ``WIRE_STANDARD_CODES`` / ``INTERNAL_CODES`` / ``ERROR_CODE_MAPPING`` /
#     ``translate_error_code`` / ``to_wire_error_code`` — a closed wire set plus a
#     boundary translator. The pin quoted above forbids the premise: a code outside
#     the published 92 is legal, and a receiver is REQUIRED to decode it from
#     ``recovery``. Collapsing MEDIA_BUY_REJECTED to POLICY_VIOLATION destroyed
#     information the spec says the buyer may consume.
#   * ``wire_advisory()`` — the one constructor for an ``errors[]`` advisory, which
#     derived recovery from the pin. ``AdcpErrorResponse.of`` derives recovery AND
#     message AND suggestion from the same pin, and takes the typed exception rather
#     than a loose (code, message) pair, so a code and its details cannot be paired
#     wrongly at the call site.
#
# What DID come across from origin/main, because nothing here subsumed it:
# ``RETRY_AFTER_MAX`` / :func:`clamp_retry_after` below, and the two-families
# reading of :class:`AdCPConfigurationError`.


# The pinned spec bounds retry_after: AdCP 3.1.1 ``core/error.json`` →
# ``retry_after`` is ``{"type": "number", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 3600}`` and its
# description reads "Sellers MUST return values between 1 and 3600. Clients MUST
# clamp values outside this range." Never emit more even when the underlying wait
# is longer. A spec constant, not an operational knob — deliberately not
# env-tunable.

    """Base exception for all AdCP errors.

    Parameterized on the detail shape it carries. Parameterizing rather than
    overriding ``__init__`` on each of the 32 error classes that carry details
    is what keeps the narrowing free of boilerplate: one ``__init__`` signature
    here, typed ``DetailsT | None``, gives every subclass its own exact detail
    type. mypy then rejects both a dict and a foreign detail class at every
    raise site, and reading ``exc.details`` back is typed without a cast.

    Class-level identity is ``_code`` and nothing else, declared with
    ``ClassVar`` per PEP 526. The public ``error_code``, ``message``,
    ``recovery``, ``suggestion`` and ``status_code`` are read-only properties
    over ``_error_code`` — functions of the code, resolved from
    ``CODE_TABLE`` at every read, so no instance can carry a value that
    disagrees with the table by any route, assignment included.

    ``status_code`` joined that list in salesagent-pssfi. It used to be a
    per-class ``_default_status_code`` slot, which let a class redeclare its
    ``_code`` and keep a status inherited from a parent that meant something
    else — ``SimulationError`` emitted INVALID_REQUEST with
    ``AdCPNotFoundError``'s 404 — and forced the plain-``ToolError`` boundary to
    reconstruct a code → status table by walking ``__subclasses__()``, whose
    answer for INVALID_REQUEST was 400 or 404 depending on the import set. There
    is now no per-class slot to disagree with, and nothing to walk.

    Code that needs class-level identity reads ``cls._code`` directly. Instance
    code reads ``self.error_code`` etc. as before.

    Attributes:
        message: Human-readable error description (read-only, from CODE_TABLE).
        status_code: HTTP status for REST/FastAPI responses (read-only, from
            CODE_TABLE).
        error_code: Machine-readable error code string (read-only).
        recovery: Recovery classification for buyer agents (read-only, from
            CODE_TABLE).
        details: Optional structured error details.
        field: Optional field name that caused the error.
        suggestion: Correction hint for buyer agents (read-only, from
            CODE_TABLE).
        internal_detail: Optional NON-WIRE cause — the caught exception that
            produced this error (ADR-010 point 5). NEVER serialized:
            ``AdcpErrorResponse.of`` ignores it; the boundary logs it with its
            traceback. An authored sentence here says nothing the code, the class
            and the typed details do not already say; every raise site passes the
            exception it caught, or nothing.
            See the class note below.

    Message provenance (AdCP 3.1.1 ``transport-errors.mdx`` § Security
    Considerations / Seller Requirements, lines 659-670): "Error responses
    flow through LLM context. Every field is client-facing. Implementations
    MUST NOT include: internal service names, hostnames, or IP addresses;
    database error text …; stack traces or file paths; upstream API responses
    from internal services; credentials, tokens, or session identifiers."

    ``adcp_error_for()`` returns an already-typed ``AdCPSalesAgentError``
    unchanged, so for a typed error THE RAISE SITE IS THE WIRE — there is no
    downstream sanitization point. That is why ``message`` is no longer
    authored at all: it is a read-only property returning
    ``CODE_TABLE[code].message``, and ``__init__`` takes no ``message``
    parameter, so the prohibited categories above cannot be interpolated into
    buyer-facing text even by accident. The trust decision is made once, in the
    table, instead of per raise site.

    Where the spec POSITIVELY requires request-specific content — version
    negotiation must name the buyer's requested version and the seller's
    supported set — that content goes in ``details``, which is exactly where
    the spec reads it from: see ``AdCPVersionUnsupportedError`` below, whose
    recovery is "re-pin to a release in the returned
    ``error.details.supported_versions``". Structured values in ``details``,
    the caught exception in ``internal_detail`` and on the ``from`` chain (written
    once to the server log by the boundary's ``record_boundary_error``, never
    emitted), and nothing at all in ``message``.

        any more, and that is the point of this refusal being one branch instead of two.

        It used to read "by its class OR explicitly", with a second branch refusing an error
        that did both. That second branch is gone with the thing it guarded:
        ``AdCPRequestSignatureError`` was the only class in the tree declaring no ``_code``,
        the only raise site passing ``error_code=``, and therefore the only reason the
        constructor accepted a code at all. It is now the abstract parent of 28 generated
        classes that each declare one, ``error_code`` is off the
        constructor entirely, and a raise site picks a CLASS and nothing else.

        What remains is the abstract-base check, which is what this branch was always for
        underneath: ``_code`` is annotation-only on the base, so ``hasattr`` is False for
        :class:`AdCPSalesAgentError` and :class:`AdCPRequestSignatureError` and True for
        every constructible class.

        TWO refusals, and nothing about ``details``. A details block needs no runtime check
        because the class is generic in its detail type and every concrete subclass binds
        one, so mypy rejects a dict and a foreign detail class at every raise site --
        docs/design/error-architecture.md § "An error names its code by its class". A third
        branch was added here for a dict that reached ``details.to_wire()``; the raise site
        had dropped the type parameter (``type[AdCPSalesAgentError]``, which erases
        ``DetailsT`` to ``Any``), so the type system was not consulted rather than
        insufficient. Parameterizing the annotation was the fix, and the branch came back out.

        ``_code`` is annotation-only on the base, so ``hasattr`` is False here and
        True on every subclass that declares one. This is the check
        ``object.__new__`` performs for an abstract class and that
        ``BaseException.__new__`` does not: ABC is a runtime no-op for exception
        classes, so without this a bare ``AdCPSalesAgentError()`` would construct and put a
        null code on the buyer's wire.

        There is still no ``synthesize()``, and the reason is now simpler than it was: a
        boundary that needs a code the class hierarchy does not model DECLARES a class for
        it. That is what the signature taxonomy did -- 28 of them, written out below. Nothing

    ABSTRACT, exactly like :class:`AdCPSalesAgentError` itself: it declares no ``_code``, so
    it cannot be constructed. What a raise site picks is one of the concrete subclasses in
    below, one per member of the request-family taxonomy, each declaring
    its own code the way every other error class in this tree does.

    This class used to NAME its code instead — the only one that did, and the only reason
    ``__new__`` had a branch permitting it. The argument for that was a class per code being
    "27 declarations that can drift from the one table", and it was simply wrong: the table
    exists either way. The verifier's translation did ``CODE_BY_VALUE[exc.code]`` to get a
    code and now does one lookup to get a class — same mapping, same size, same drift
    surface, a different value type. Nothing was saved, and what it cost was the invariant's
    universality: "an error names a code by its class" stopped being a property nothing can
    violate and became a convention with one exception in it.

    A DIRECT subclass, not one of :class:`AdCPAuthenticationError`, although what it says is
    the same kind of thing: a credential was presented and did not verify. Inheriting
    AUTH_INVALID would give every one of these classes that code through the MRO, and the
    whole point of the taxonomy is that the code differs per refusal. The relation that
    mattered about that parent is kept where it is actually enforced: ``ruff-boundary.toml``
    bans this class outside the resolver beside the other two, so the three refusals of a
    buyer's credential have one author between them.

    Recovery, suggestion, message and the 401 all come from ``CODE_TABLE`` like every other
    code — this changed WHO NAMES THE CODE and nothing about where the buyer-facing text
    comes from. What the buyer gets that is specific to the refusal is the CODE, twice: in
    ``error.code``, and in the ``WWW-Authenticate`` challenge ``AuthChallengeResponder``
    derives from it. The verifier's own exception — which carries the checklist step and a
    diagnostic sentence — rides ``internal_detail``, server log only.

# Twenty-eight class statements, in enum order, so a reader can check them off against

# subclasses in this module are: a class is this seller's PUBLIC API, and an API must not be
# a function of an upstream string.
#
# They were briefly GENERATED from the enum -- ``type(name, (base,), {"_code": code})`` over
# a comprehension -- and that is rejected. ``SignatureErrorCode`` is itself derived from the
# SDK's taxonomy, so generating classes from it means an SDK UPGRADE CAN RENAME OUR CLASSES:
# upstream respells a code, ``AdCPRequestSignatureKeyRevokedError`` quietly becomes something
# else, every ``except`` naming it stops matching, and nothing fails at build time because
# there is no source line to change and no diff to review. Typed out, the same upstream
# change is an ``AttributeError`` at import on the line that names the member -- a conflict a
# human reads. That trade is the whole point: a drift that is cheap to see beats a drift that
# is impossible to see.

    All are SELLER-side store defects — the buyer neither supplied the value nor can

    Emits the PUBLISHED ``VALIDATION_ERROR``, not a platform code. This class briefly
    carried a minted ``URL_NOT_ALLOWED`` on the reasoning that VALIDATION_ERROR "tells a
    buyer nothing they can act on differently". That reasoning does not survive the pin:
    malformed-vs-value-refused is already the published INVALID_REQUEST / VALIDATION_ERROR
    split (INVALID_REQUEST is "malformed, missing required fields, or violates schema
    constraints"; VALIDATION_ERROR is "invalid field values or violates business rules
    beyond schema validation"), and a schema-valid https URI refused by a deny-list is the
    second. The pinned spec then applies it to this exact vector:
    ``dist/docs/3.1.0/learning/specialist/security.mdx:84`` has the practitioner register
    ``https://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`` and "observe that the agent refuses it
    synchronously with a ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` on ``notification_configs[].url``".

    The open vocabulary permits minting a code the spec has NOT defined; it does not make
    a private synonym of a published member a good idea, because a buyer switching on
    ``error.code`` across sellers loses the ability to handle this uniformly.

    The class survives the code change on purpose: the A2A boundary catches it BY TYPE to
    select ``InvalidParamsError``, which a bare ``AdCPValidationError`` could not express
    without also catching every other validation failure. Being a SUBCLASS costs nothing
    there — ``isinstance`` still discriminates the URL refusal exactly.

    It is a subclass rather than a sibling because two fail-closed handlers depend on the
    subsumption, and both are load-bearing rather than incidental:
    ``src/services/delivery_webhook_scheduler.py`` and ``src/core/context_manager.py`` each
    wrap the registration gate (``webhooks/registration.py`` →
    ``reject_unsafe_webhook_registration_url``) in ``except AdCPValidationError`` precisely
    so a refused registration becomes a logged non-delivery instead of an exception that
    kills the scheduler loop or fails a status transition. As a direct
    ``AdCPSalesAgentError`` subclass — which is how this branch declared it — an SSRF
    refusal escapes both. The parent's ``ValidationDetails`` replaces the
    ``ValueRejectionDetails`` this class was parameterized on; no raise site in the tree
    passes ``details=`` to it, so that parameter was carrying nothing.

    The buyer's actionable signal is the CODE plus ``field`` (which URL was refused). The
    rejection REASON never reaches the buyer -- the spec's Security Considerations forbid
    disclosing internal service names, hostnames or IP addresses, so the cause rides
    ``internal_detail`` (server log only). Deliberate loss in the switch: the retired
    entry's suggestion enumerated the refused host classes, where VALIDATION_ERROR's is
    the generic "review error details and fix field values". A per-class override is NOT
    the fix -- it would make the suggestion a function of the class rather than the code,
    which ADR-010 forbids (the override knob that once allowed it is deleted).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An alias, not a class: the pair below is ONE concept that the two branches
# named differently, so binding a second name costs nothing, while defining a
# second class would put two answers on the wire for one failure.
#
# ``AdCPBlockedUrlError`` is origin/main's name for the SSRF refusal, and the two
# were ONE condition, not two: the pinned 3.1.1 ``enums/error-code.json`` defines
# no URL/SSRF code at all (the nearest, AGENT_BLOCKED, is about a blocked AGENT),
# and both branches already resolved a refused URL to the same published
# VALIDATION_ERROR — "invalid field values or violates business rules beyond
# schema validation", as against INVALID_REQUEST's "malformed ... or violates
# schema constraints". A schema-valid https URI refused by a deny-list is the
# former. So the spec distinguishes nothing here for a second class to carry, and
# there is one class with one alias.
#
# The surviving class takes origin/main's HIERARCHY (subclass of
# AdCPValidationError) and this branch's NAME and body — see the class docstring
# for why the hierarchy half is a behavior fix rather than a preference.
# origin/main's other difference, an authored ``_default_message`` ("URL resolves
# to a restricted range."), is subsumed: the message here is the code's own table
# sentence, which is the ADR-010 rule the whole taxonomy follows and which keeps
# the refused host out of buyer-facing text by construction.
