"""The environment, read once, as typed state.

This module is the ONE reader of the process environment. It is read when the application
is composed (``load_settings``), into a :class:`Settings` object whose fields and derived
properties are what the rest of the tree depends on. No module reads ``os.environ`` after
import, and no request-time code asks what environment it is in: it reads a named fact off
the settings, or it is handed the component the composition root selected for that fact.

Two shapes of fact live here:

- **Values**: a port, a domain, a key, a limit. Plain fields.
- **Allowances and selections**: whether loopback webhook targets are accepted, whether the
  debug routes exist, whether the creative registry serves the checked-in reference formats.
  These are named properties derived from the fields, so a call site reads the allowance it
  needs rather than the raw flag that implies it. ``ADCP_TESTING`` implies six different
  allowances; each has its own name, and the composition root uses them to pick components.

``load_settings`` rebuilds the object (a test that changes the environment calls it);
``get_settings`` returns the current one, building it on first use so a script that never
composed an app still gets a consistent view. Nothing builds it at import: a module that
needs one runtime fact while its classes are being defined (the request DTOs' extra mode)
reads :class:`RuntimeSettings` alone, so a bad credential fails where the app is composed,
not when a schema is imported.

An empty value is an unset value. CI and the compose files hand a process ``ADCP_TESTING=""``
or ``DB_PORT=""`` (``${VAR:-}``), and the helpers this module replaced read those as the
default; ``env_ignore_empty`` keeps that reading.

    it (CLAUDE.md pattern 11). So this class is a WORK LIST, not a configuration surface:
    it may only lose fields, which ``tests/unit/test_testing_settings_only_shrinks.py``
    pins. Nothing may be added.

    Each field's production readers, and what has to happen before it can go:

    * ``adcp_testing`` -- one decision, ``webhook_validator.py:196``, which loosens
      ``EgressPolicy.check_registration``'s loopback check while a suite runs. The
      replacement is reachable loopback origins in the test environments -- the same work
      the outbound private-address hatch needs. That hatch's env var is deliberately not
      spelled out here: ``test_architecture_no_outbound_insecure_hatch`` counts a literal
      mention as a declaration site, which is the right reading for a flag that can
      disable the address gate, so naming it in prose would quietly widen its pin. The
      seven properties on this class that used to fork on ``adcp_testing`` are already
      pinned shrink-only (GH #2255).
    * ``adcp_auth_test_mode`` -- one reader, ``src/admin/app.py:351``, deciding whether
      the test-credential login blueprint is COMPOSED. It goes when first-run admin setup
      has an answer that is not a test flag (salesagent-091d8): today that blueprint is
      the only non-SSO path to a first admin session, and the deployment docs instruct
      operators to use it.
    * the six ``test_*`` credentials -- read at ONE site, ``test_auth.py:63,68,73``, as
      that blueprint's credential table. They go with the blueprint.

    Provisioning facts a deployment legitimately sets -- seed a demo tenant, seed sample
    data, skip migrations -- are NOT here; they are :class:`ProvisioningSettings`. They sat
