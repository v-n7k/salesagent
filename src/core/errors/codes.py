"""The one table every buyer-facing error resolves against.

An error code is a label. This module maps each label to the four things a
buyer needs with it: how to recover, what to do about it, what happened, and
the HTTP status the failure is signalled with. Nothing else in the codebase
decides those four per raise site.

The 92 codes AdCP publishes are LOADED from the pinned schema bundle inside the
installed ``adcp`` wheel -- ``enums/error-code.json``, whose ``enumMetadata``
block the spec marks normative ("SDKs MUST consume this block instead of parsing
'Recovery: X' from enumDescriptions prose"). A loaded table cannot drift from the
file it came from, so it needs no guard checking that it hasn't. A transcribed
one would.

``recovery``, ``suggestion`` AND ``message`` all come from that file and nowhere
else. A message is the first of two sources that has one: authored below, then
the file's own ``enumDescriptions`` prose.

There used to be a third source between them -- the SDK's
``STANDARD_ERROR_CODES`` -- and it was the one thing here not read from the pin.
It carried a message for 37 of the 92 published codes, so it shadowed published
text for those 37 while adding nothing for the other 55, and its coverage did
not grow with the enum. An ``adcp`` bump could therefore rewrite 37 live
buyer-facing strings with the pinned schema unchanged. Everywhere else in this
codebase the SDK is treated as a cross-check rather than the authority: the
pinned enumMetadata says "SDKs MUST consume this block ... the recovery
classification embedded in that prose is normative and MUST match the value
here", and where the shipped SDK values disagreed with the pin it was the SDK
that was drifting. Message was the last field that still disagreed on which of
the two wins, so it now answers the same way the other three do.

The platform codes in :class:`AppErrorCode` are this seller's own. The spec's
vocabulary is open by design -- ``core/error.json`` (AdCP 3.1.1): ``error.code``
is a wire-typed string rather than a closed enum, the published codes are
documentary, senders MAY emit codes outside that set, and receivers MUST decode
unknown ones by reading ``error.recovery``. So a code outside the 92 is legal,
and ``recovery`` is the part that must stay inside its three values.

Loading happens at import, because deferring it buys nothing. It is one bounded
read of one file shipped inside a package the process has already imported, and
the path is package-relative -- derived from ``importlib.resources``, not the
working directory -- so importability does not depend on where the process was
started or which uid started it. Making it lazy would add a cache, a module
``__getattr__`` and a ``TYPE_CHECKING`` declaration to move that read a few
microseconds later.

    put a blank buyer-facing field on every raise of that code. Checking it at
    the one place entries are built — pinned-schema load and platform authorship
    alike — means no test or raise site ever needs to re-check non-emptiness.

    ``status`` is the HTTP status the failure is signalled with. It belongs to
    the CODE, not to whichever exception class happened to raise it: the pinned
    schema states the transport-level failure marker per code — ``HTTP 5xx`` for
    CONFIGURATION_ERROR and GOVERNANCE_UNAVAILABLE, ``HTTP 4xx`` for
    GOVERNANCE_DENIED and CREDENTIAL_IN_ARGS (``enums/error-code.json``,

    docstring). Each one names a failure this seller can distinguish and a buyer
    can act on differently -- collapsing them onto a published code would throw
    that distinction away, which is the opposite of what an open vocabulary is
    for.

    No member may name a vendor. A buyer integrates with this seller, not with
    whatever ad server sits behind it, and a code is part of the contract: once
    ``GAM_UPDATE_FAILED`` is on the wire, swapping ad servers is a breaking
    change to every buyer parsing it. The two ad-server codes are therefore
    named for the operation that failed, not the system that failed it.

    Each member carries its own :class:`CodeEntry`, so declaring a code and
    declaring what it means are one act -- a member with no entry is a
    ``TypeError`` at class creation, not a lookup that fails later on an
    error path.

    Recovery follows the same rule the spec applies to its own codes --
    correctable when the buyer can change the request and retry, transient when
    the same request may succeed later, terminal when neither is true. Messages
    reach buyer agents, so they say what happened in the buyer's terms and never
    name an internal component.
