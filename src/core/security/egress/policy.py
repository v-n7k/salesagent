"""The address/scheme policy shared by both egress verdicts.

Two verdicts exist because the seam is asked two different questions at two
different times: :func:`EgressPolicy.check_registration` is the DNS-free
verdict a webhook (or other stored) URL earns at *registration*, before there
is any request to attach a refusal to; :func:`EgressPolicy.resolve_for_dial`
is the DNS-full, IP-pinning verdict a URL earns the moment something is
actually about to dial it. Both read the SAME address predicate
(:func:`_blocked_address`) and the SAME hostname blocklist and scheme rule —
one shared value, not two independently-maintained copies, which is the
disease this module exists to make structurally impossible (GH #974,
GH #974).

AdCP 3.1.1, ``building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx``: a fetcher MUST (1) reject
non-HTTPS in production, (2) reject reserved ranges — including RFC 6598
CGNAT — (6) never echo the refusal cause back to the party that supplied the
URL. Neither verdict tells the caller WHY it refused — that is point 6. The cause
strings below are for the log; ``AdCPBlockedUrlError`` owns what the caller
is told.
