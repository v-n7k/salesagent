"""The one place a webhook payload becomes signed bytes and those bytes go out.

Core Invariant (#1441): a webhook sender must never hold a signer
and a body serializer as two independent decisions. One function serializes
the body once, optionally signs those exact bytes, and transmits those exact
bytes via ``content=`` through :mod:`src.core.security.outbound_http`. No
webhook sender may reach ``json=`` on the egress seam.

Spec grounding: pinned AdCP 3.1.1,
``docs/building/by-layer/L3/webhooks.mdx:404-418`` — the legacy
HMAC-SHA256 fallback signs ``{unix_timestamp}.{raw_body_bytes}`` and requires
``X-ADCP-Signature: sha256=<hex digest>`` / ``X-ADCP-Timestamp: <unix
seconds>`` on compact-separator JSON. ``adcp.sign_legacy_webhook`` (the
installed ``adcp==6.6.0`` SDK) implements exactly this and is a cross-check
confirming the spec reading, not the authority.

Placed beside :mod:`outbound_http` rather than in ``src/services/``: this is
egress policy (what bytes represent a payload, and how those bytes are
authenticated), not business logic.

Signer-side duplicate-object-key MUST (salesagent-47n9.19; pinned AdCP 3.1.1,
``docs/building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx`` §Duplicate object keys):
signers MUST reject duplicate-key input before signing. ``prepare_signed_request``
takes ``payload: dict[str, Any]`` — a Python ``dict`` cannot represent a
duplicate key, so this MUST is satisfied *by construction*: there is no
production path in this codebase that feeds this function parsed-from-text
JSON (every payload source is already a dict — ``_to_wire_dict`` and
JSONB-sourced rows). Do NOT add a ``bytes``/``str``-accepting overload "for
convenience" — it would have no caller today, and it would reopen exactly the
gap this paragraph closes. ``tests/unit/test_architecture_no_webhook_egress_text_payload.py``
guards this as a build failure, not just a paragraph: if a future PR needs a
text-accepting entry point, it MUST route the text through
:func:`src.core.security.webhook_strict_json.loads_rejecting_duplicate_keys`
first.

    that has not implemented the 9421 profile yet.

    Constructing ``PushAuthentication`` (the push-config narrowing of the one local
    Authentication concept, src/core/schemas/notification.py: ``credentials`` required, as
    that pin declares and as signing needs) IS the validation: ``credentials`` is required with ``minLength: 32`` and ``schemes``
    has ``maxItems: 1``, and the enum is the pin's own, unwidened. A scheme
    outside it is REFUSED rather than folded, and casing is not folded either --
    ``"bearer"`` refuses exactly as ``"Digest"`` does. So there is no
    supported-set to keep in step with the spec and no per-sender branching: a
    caller either gets a validated block or an outcome.

    The blank-scheme pair is TWO different documents and must not be conflated:
    no scheme and no credential means there was no ``authentication`` block at
    all (the spec's own selector for the RFC 9421 baseline, so deliver plain),

    array was empty — which the pinned type refuses, and which
