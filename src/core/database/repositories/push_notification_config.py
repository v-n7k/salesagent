        Takes the VALUE, not three loose strings. ``ValidatedWebhookRegistration``
        is the receipt that both ingest preconditions ran — the registration SSRF
        gate on the URL half and the pinned ``Authentication`` model built inside
        ``_accept`` on the credential half — so persisting a config that skipped a
        gate no longer type-checks.

        That is why this module no longer re-validates the URL. The former
        "defense-in-depth" check here existed because the receipt evaporated at
        this boundary: a caller that had never gated looked exactly like one that
        had. It also could not produce a good error — the repository cannot know
        the request path, so ``error.field`` was lost. SEND time is not this
        module's business either: every outbound request goes through the egress
        seam (``src.core.security.outbound_http``), which re-resolves and re-judges
        the URL when it is actually dialled.

        The three kwargs are deliberately NOT value fields, and every one of them
        is preserve-if-not-passed: omitting one keeps the existing row's value
        (``None`` on insert), passing ``None`` explicitly clears it.
        ``validation_token`` is sender-side ``X-Webhook-Token`` material, outside
        the auth resolver; ``webhook_secret`` is the admin-registered HMAC secret.
        Callers share config ids across paths, so a caller that does not OWN a
        field must not null it — an unconditional write would let the
        create-media-buy path silently clear a ``validation_token`` another path
        set.
