"""Cross-tenant lookups on the ``tenants`` table's unique keys.

Deliberately NOT tenant-scoped, unlike ``TenantConfigRepository``: these answer
"is this key already taken, by anyone?" for the handlers that create or rename a
tenant. A tenant-scoped repository cannot express that question — the whole point
is that the row you collide with belongs to somebody else.

Each method maps to one of the three unique keys on ``tenants``
(``tenants_pkey``, ``tenants_subdomain_key``, ``ix_tenants_virtual_host``), so a
handler recovering from one of those constraints via ``resolve_or_write`` can
re-resolve to the winner through the same method its pre-check used.

Note the absence of an ``is_active`` filter: an inactive tenant still occupies
its subdomain in the index, so filtering it out (as ``config_loader``'s routing
lookup does, correctly, for its own purpose) would answer "free" for a key that
is not.
