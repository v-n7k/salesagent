"""Tenant-scoped access to this agent's own RFC 9421 signing keys.

Backs #1291 A2 (salesagent-z6nr.8). Every ``select(SigningKey)`` in the codebase
lives here — the structural guard forbids raw model queries outside the
repository layer, and the tenant scope is exactly what a stray query would drop.

Three selectors, and the differences matter:

* :meth:`active_at` — which key we SIGN with at an instant. Governed by the
  ``[not_before, not_after)`` window plus ``revoked_at``.
* :meth:`publishable_at` — which keys we PUBLISH at an instant. Governed by
  ``revoked_at`` plus the ``agent-signing-key`` schema's grace period, and by
  NEITHER window bound. Publication is window-blind by design.
* :meth:`all_revoked` — the PERMANENT revocation record, with no grace cutoff
  at all, because a kid dropped from that list is a kid un-revoked.

        about to sign with. Opening a second session there could observe a rotation from
        one side and the host from the other.

        THIS METHOD REPLACED A ``session`` PROPERTY (#1757). That property handed out the
        raw session and asked callers, in fourteen lines of docstring, to use it only for
        a sibling repository and to remember that the no-raw-select guards still applied
        to whoever borrowed it. It was a PRIMITIVE PLUS PROSE, and the prose was the only
        thing holding the invariant up: nothing stopped a caller opening a second session,
        which is the exact race the docstring warned about. Three call sites — the RFC
        9421 sender, the adapter client builder, and the test harness — each re-derived
        the same origin from it, identically, differing only in how they handled ``None``.
        One operation, written out three times, guarded by a request.

        session because it never receives the first one. Returns ``None`` when the tenant
        row is absent, which is what every one of those call sites did by hand.

        Mirrors :meth:`active_at`'s scope and ordering, minus the window — and
        the omission is the whole point:

        * **Never ``not_after``.** Un-publishing a key whose window has closed
          strands every signature it made that is still inside its verification
          window — the exact gap rotation overlap exists to prevent.
        * **Never ``not_before``.** Rotation must publish the incoming key
          BEFORE it signs, so that every verifier's cache already holds it when
          the first signature arrives.

        Consequence, and it is a REQUIREMENT on callers rather than a caveat:
        **retirement MUST set ``revoked_at``** (:meth:`revoke`). Closing the
        window retires a SIGNER; it never retires a PUBLICATION, so a key
        retired only by ``not_after`` would be published forever.

        ``revoked_at`` is the sole exit, and it is delayed by *grace_seconds*:
        ``core/agent-signing-key.json`` says a revoked key "MAY continue to
        appear in the trust anchor during a grace period so caches that have not
        yet refreshed still find the key and can evaluate the revocation
        marker", and may be removed "once the cache TTL ... has elapsed across
        all verifiers". The published documents carry the marker for exactly
        that reason.

        *purpose* is filtered because ``security.mdx``:1079 forbids co-tenanting
        purposes in one JWKS ("governance signing keys MUST be served from a
        separate origin"). Latent today — ``MINTABLE_PURPOSES`` holds one value
        — and a latent violation of a MUST is still one. The SAME :1079
        divergence is knowingly repeated by
        :mod:`src.core.signing.revocation_list` — the combined revocation list
        is signed with this tenant's request-signing key rather than a
        separate governance key, for the same reason (none is mintable yet).

        *purpose* filters (unlike the combined list's own scope, which per
        :1328 covers "governance, request-signing, and any other agent signing
        keys") because this deployment mints exactly one purpose today
        (``MINTABLE_PURPOSES``) — the asymmetry with :meth:`publishable_at`'s

        filter on the one purpose that exists. Widening to "every purpose"
