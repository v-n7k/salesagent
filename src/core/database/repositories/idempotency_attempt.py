"""IdempotencyAttempt repository — tenant-scoped access to the verbatim success cache.

AdCP 3.0.1 idempotency contract: retrying a mutating tool call with the same
idempotency_key must return the ORIGINAL success response byte-for-byte (marked
``replayed: true``), and errors are NEVER cached — a retry after an error
re-executes. This repository stores and replays those cached successes, keyed by
``(tenant_id, principal_id, account_id, idempotency_key)`` — the spec's
idempotency tuple exactly. ``tool_name`` is recorded for observability only,
never as a scope dimension: a key reused by a different tool hits the same row
and conflicts on its differing payload hash. ``MediaBuy.idempotency_key`` remains the
dup-booking backstop; this table holds the verbatim response to replay.

The default TTL is 24h (matches the value announced via
get_adcp_capabilities.adcp.idempotency.replay_ttl_seconds = 86400).
