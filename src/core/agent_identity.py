"""The ONE canonical agent identity for a tenant (#1291, trust-root work item A3).

Every trust-root document this agent publishes, and every URL a counterparty
byte-matches against, is derived from :func:`canonical_agent_url`. That is the
whole point of this module: the byte-equal ``agents[].url`` match a verifier
performs (AdCP 3.1.1 ``security.mdx``:1104 step 5, "no canonicalization at this
step"), the eTLD+1 origin binding (step 3), and the ``key_origins`` consistency
check can never disagree with each other or with where our keys actually
resolve — because they are one string plus a suffix, by construction.

Why a module rather than a helper next to its first caller: before this, FOUR
independent derivations existed (the agent card's per-request header ladder, the
A2A static default, the admin blueprint's PRODUCTION/localhost ladder, and the
env-only ``domain_config`` primitives). N derivations means N chances that the
URL we publish and the URL a counterparty invoked differ by a scheme, a port or
a trailing slash — and each of those is a failed verification with no
diagnostic.

Two rules that look like details and are not:

* **The endpoint paths are the paths the app actually serves.** Starlette mounts
  ``/mcp`` and answers ``GET /mcp`` with a 307 to ``/mcp/``; ``/a2a`` is a
  JSON-RPC route served at exactly that path. The counterparty invoked
  ``get_adcp_capabilities`` at one of those, so those are the strings that must
  appear in ``brand.json``. A trailing-slash mismatch is the spec's own worked
  failure example (``https://x.com/mcp`` vs ``https://x.com/mcp/``).
* **The scheme is derived from the host, never from request headers.**
  ``security.mdx`` step 10 forbids deriving identity from reverse-proxy routing
  state; a tenant that answers on several hosts would otherwise publish several
  different identities.

``ADCP_AGENT_URL`` survives here as a DEPLOYMENT-level base for installs that
have no per-tenant host at all — deliberately ranked BELOW the tenant's own
host, because a deployment-wide literal that overrode a per-tenant identity
would collapse every tenant onto one URL, which is the defect this module
exists to remove.
