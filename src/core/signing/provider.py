"""Resolve a ``SigningProvider`` for a tenant: row -> ref -> PEM -> tripwire -> provider.

We construct ``adcp.signing.InMemorySigningProvider``; we never subclass it and
never implement the Protocol ourselves. Its ``__init__`` already type- and
curve-checks the private key against the algorithm, so this module does not.

Contract reminder, because getting it wrong is silent: ``sign`` is ASYNC, and
``key_id()`` / ``algorithm()`` are METHODS. Attribute access yields a truthy
bound method, which is how ``<bound method ...>`` ends up in a ``keyid`` header.
