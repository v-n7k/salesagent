"""Checklist step 9 — revocation — decided by exactly one callable.

#1291 A5 (salesagent-z6nr.11).

Core invariant
--------------
Step 9 is decided by one :class:`CounterpartyRevocationChecker` handed to
``VerifyOptions.revocation_checker``. It owns BOTH halves of the step
(membership and staleness), translates every failure it can raise into a typed
:class:`~adcp.signing.errors.SignatureVerificationError` before it leaves our
code, and is reached only through the SDK checklist — so revocation keeps
running before crypto verify without anything in salesagent reordering,
re-deciding or second-sourcing it.

Spec grounding (reproducible):
``git -C ~/projects/adcp show v3.1.1:docs/building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx``
— :1238 (step 9), :1328 (one combined list at the brand.json origin), :1333
(fetch-failure safe default, grace = 4x the previous polling interval),
:1686-1689 (the checklist pseudo-code). Graded at the wire by compliance vector
``negative/017-key-revoked`` (B3, salesagent-z6nr.14).

Why a wrapper at all, and not the SDK checker straight through
--------------------------------------------------------------
The SDK's checklist calls the revocation checker with no ``try``, and
``CachingRevocationChecker`` raises bare ``Exception`` subclasses. The only catch on that
path is ``_verify_signed``'s ``except SignatureVerificationError``
(``src/core/signing/verifier.py``), so every one of those escapes the boundary and becomes
a 500 instead of the graded 401. The SDK's
own docstring (``revocation_fetcher.py:600-602``) claims the verifier maps
``RevocationListFreshnessError`` to ``request_signature_revocation_stale``; it
does not. This module is that missing translation, and it is a SINGLE site —
:meth:`CounterpartyRevocationChecker.__call__`'s one ``except`` tuple — rather
than a per-exception ladder, because it is one decision.

Ordering inside step 9, and the spec's own contradiction
--------------------------------------------------------
**The locally-configured revoked set is checked FIRST and answers immediately;
only then is the fetched list consulted, with staleness decided inside it.**

The spec contradicts itself on this ordering and no vector grades the
combination: the checklist prose at :1238 lists membership first ("Reject if
``keyid`` in ``revoked_kids`` ... Reject with
``request_signature_revocation_stale`` if ..."), while the pseudo-code at
:1686-1689 checks ``isRevocationStale()`` before ``isKeyRevoked()``. Both
orderings are equally fail-closed. We follow :1238 for the LOCAL set because a
locally-configured revocation is a permanent known fact with no staleness
question attached to it, and because the alternative couples an unrelated
config flag to a graded outcome: under fetched-first, a deployment that set
``require_revocation_list=True`` would answer ``_revocation_stale`` for the
seeded ``test-revoked-2026`` (the conformance runner's origin publishes no
list), turning vector 017 into a FAIL. The pseudo-code's stale-before-membership
ordering is preserved where it actually applies — inside the fetched checker,
where ``_ensure_fresh`` runs before ``is_revoked``.

Do not "fix" this to match :1686-1689 without re-reading both citations.

Concurrency
-----------
``_run_verifier`` runs under the ``asyncio.to_thread`` that ``invoke_tool`` resolves
identity in (``src/core/tools/_boundary.py``), which is exactly the thread-pool case
``revocation_fetcher.py:609-618`` says needs an external lock. The lock is
therefore PER ISSUER ORIGIN and held only around that origin's check — never one
process-wide lock, which would be held across the 10s-default HTTPS fetch inside
``_ensure_fresh`` and let one dead counterparty stall every signed request in
the process.
