"""The bounded OPERATION VOCABULARY — every name a signature metric label can carry.

``operation`` is a Prometheus LABEL on all three request-signature counters
(:mod:`src.core.metrics`). Before #1721 its value came VERBATIM out of the request body
on two of the three transports — ``params.name`` for an MCP ``tools/call``,
``data.skill`` for an A2A ``message/send`` — and the verifier ran ABOVE authentication,
so recording it raw let an anonymous ``POST /mcp`` mint one new time series per request
forever, in a long-running multi-tenant process.

That hazard is SMALLER on #1721's boundary and the bound is kept anyway. The verifier now
runs inside ``_resolve_identity``, which ``invoke_tool`` reaches only after
``TOOLS[tool_name]`` resolved — so the label is already a registry key by construction on
every transport, and an unknown name never gets that far. The bound stays because the
counters are also written from paths that record no tool at all (a refusal raised before
a name is known records ``""``), and because a bound that exists only as an argument
about reachability stops holding the day a caller changes.

DERIVED, never hand-listed. A hand-written copy would be a second source of truth for the
same surface, and it fails the way second copies always fail: silently, on the day a tool
is added, by demoting that tool's real traffic into the bucket that exists to alarm on
attacker-supplied names.

THE LEAF RULE: nothing here imports :mod:`src.core.metrics`, :mod:`src.core.config` or
:mod:`src.core.database` at module level, and the registry is read through a
FUNCTION-LOCAL import at first call. ``src/app.py`` imports the metrics module while the
route table is still being assembled, so a module-level read would run against a
half-built application.
