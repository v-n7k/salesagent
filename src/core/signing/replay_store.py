"""Postgres-backed :class:`adcp.signing.replay.ReplayStore` (#1291 A4, salesagent-z6nr.10).

A nonce is accepted at most once DEPLOYMENT-WIDE within its signature window. The
SDK's ``InMemoryReplayStore`` cannot promise that — it is process-local, so with
several workers a nonce accepted on worker A stays replayable on worker B for the
whole window; its own docstring says as much. This store puts the state in Postgres,
where every worker shares it.

Backend choice (recorded per the ticket): implemented over SQLAlchemy rather than
adopting ``adcp[pg]``'s ``PgReplayStore``, which hard-requires psycopg3 and opens its
own ``ConnectionPool`` beside SQLAlchemy's. One driver, one pool — and the SDK store
would have had to be fixed anyway (see ``ReplayNonceRepository`` on the seen/remember
race).

**``seen()`` is a WRITING atomic claim, and that is only safe because of the pinned
SDK's call order.** At ``adcp==6.6.0`` the verifier calls ``at_capacity`` at
``verifier.py:304`` (step 9a), ``verify_signature`` at ``:329``, the Content-Digest
check at ``:339``, and only then ``seen`` at ``:348`` and ``remember`` at ``:358``.
So a claim only ever fires for a cryptographically valid, digest-matching request:
an attacker cannot burn nonces or inflate the per-keyid count without holding a valid
signature. That is a property of the SDK VERSION, not of the ``ReplayStore`` Protocol
(``adcp/signing/replay.py:21-28`` is structural and does not forbid ``seen`` from
writing). ``tests/integration/test_replay_store.py::TestClaimHappensAfterCryptoVerify``
is the tripwire that makes an SDK bump moving ``seen()`` earlier fail loudly instead
of silently turning this store into a DoS amplifier.

**Row lifetime belongs to ``remember()``, not to the claim.** The verifier hands
``remember`` a TTL computed from the SIGNATURE (``ttl = expires - now + max_skew``,
``verifier.py:354``) and the only-extend predicate raises any shorter claim to it. The
claim TTL only has to bridge ``seen()`` to ``remember()`` plus a crash in between.

Ordering hazard this creates for conformance grading (designed for, not accidental —
B3/salesagent-z6nr.14 inherits it): the signed-requests test-kit's vectors carry a
300s window, so without a clamp every accepted request for ``test-ed25519-2026`` would
leave a row live ~360s — 6x the kit's ``window_seconds: 60``. Vector ``020-rate-abuse``
drives that keyid to its overridden cap of 100, and those rows would then trip step 9a
for every LATER vector, including ``016-replayed-nonce``'s first (must-be-accepted)
submission. ``replay_ttl_overrides`` clamps the runner counterparties to ~70s, which is
above ``min_replay_ttl_seconds: 10`` and ``max_interval_seconds: 5`` (so 016 still
grades and cannot false-green) and above ``window_seconds: 60`` (so 020 still reaches
the cap), while draining between vectors. The clamp is sound ONLY per-counterparty —
it shortens replay protection below the signature's own validity window — which is why
:class:`~src.core.config.SigningSettings` refuses a global one.

Spec grounding: AdCP 3.1.1 via ``adcp==6.6.0``;
``dist/compliance/3.1.1/test-kits/signed-requests-runner.yaml``; graded at the wire by
vectors ``016-replayed-nonce`` (``request_signature_replayed``) and ``020-rate-abuse``
(``request_signature_rate_abuse``).
