"""The per-request ``request_signing`` posture — ONE object for advertise and enforce.

#1291 B1, re-homed onto #1721's request boundary.

``request_signing`` is a *behavioral* declaration: ``covers_content_digest`` and the
operation buckets are tenant-declared but they change what the VERIFIER does. So the
block the agent advertises on ``get_adcp_capabilities`` and the capability the verifier
enforces must come from one object; two sources is a correctness bug that advertises a
posture we do not enforce (or vice versa).

:class:`RequestSigningPosture` is that object. It extends the AdCP library type — no
re-declaration (CLAUDE.md Pattern #1) — and adds the two derivations the verifier needs:

* :meth:`RequestSigningPosture.bucket_for` — the schema's ``required_for >
  supported_for`` precedence, over the TWO buckets a tenant can declare
  (``docs/design/request-signing-subset.md``);
* :meth:`RequestSigningPosture.to_verifier_capability` — the projection onto the 4 fields
  ``VerifierCapability`` carries, kept in one place.

:func:`posture_for_tenant` is the single READER of the tenant declaration, and it now
takes the loaded :class:`~src.core.tenant_context.TenantContext` the resolver already
holds. On the pre-merge branch it took a ``PostureTenant`` TypedDict projected out of a
second, verifier-owned tenant lookup (``_detect_tenant_for_posture``) that existed only
because the ASGI middleware ran BEFORE identity resolution. Inside ``_resolve_identity``
there is exactly one tenant read, so the projection, the second lookup and the
swallow-everything failure mode around it are all deleted.

``webhook_signing`` sits beside it and is DERIVED, never declared: ``supported`` from key
material plus trust-root publishability, ``algorithms`` from the ACTIVE key row,
``profile`` from the SDK tag the signer emits. :func:`webhook_signing_posture` is its one
producer, and the outbound delivery signer
(``src.core.signing.outbound.webhook_delivery_signer``) gates on the same key state, so
the wire and the socket cannot disagree about whether we sign or with what.

    gates on the SAME key state, so the wire and the socket cannot disagree in either
    direction.

    The ``legacy_hmac_fallback`` predicate is imported function-locally, the same shape
    as the function-local ``get_settings`` in :func:`signing_key_backed`: this module
    must stay free of transport and DB imports at module scope.

    *key_backing*: pass an already-derived :class:`KeyBacking` when the caller also
    needs ``.publishes`` (e.g. capabilities' identity/key_origins gate) so
    :func:`signing_key_backed` runs ONCE per request instead of being re-derived here
    -- a second derivation is how the advertised posture and the enforced one drift
    apart (see :class:`KeyBacking`'s own docstring). Defaults to ``None`` for callers
    that hold only a repository.

    ``signs`` additionally requires that this deployment can OPEN the row's private

    encryption key named by ``SigningSettings.key_passphrase_env``. Minting refuses
    without it (``src/core/signing/keys.py``) and ``resolve_signing_material`` needs it
    again at every use — so a row minted under a KEK that was later unset, or under a
    DIFFERENT KEK than this process holds (a rotated KEK, a per-environment mismatch, a
    stale secret), is a key we cannot open, and reporting it as backing means the wire
    says ``supported: true`` while every delivery raises.

    This ATTEMPTS the real resolution (via :func:`~src.core.signing.provider.resolve_signing_material`)
    rather than only checking that SOME passphrase is configured — presence is not
    correctness. The three WARNINGs are deliberately distinct so an operator can tell
    "no key" from "a passphrase is configured but it's the wrong one": the first two are
    provisioning gaps, the third is a deployment misconfiguration with the key material
    intact. Reuses the SAME per-(tenant, kid) resolution cache signing itself uses
    (``_provider_cache``) — cache success, never errors, so a later-fixed KEK is retried
    on the next call rather than pinned as permanently unresolvable.

    Every row is checked, because every row's private half is the ciphertext on it:
    there is no other place a key can live and so no row whose resolvability is
