"""Publish OUR combined revocation list (#1291 A5 follow-up, salesagent-z6nr.27).

security.mdx :1543 is the MUST that binds us: "Signers MUST publish
revocations via the same combined revocation list used for request
signing" — it binds us as a SIGNER of outbound requests and webhooks, not
as the inbound verifier (that half, A5/salesagent-z6nr.11, is complete and
lives in :func:`src.core.signing.verifier.verify_inbound_signature`, which
``_resolve_identity`` calls behind the tool boundary). This is the mirror
half: the publisher, next to :mod:`src.core.signing.trust_root`.

Same contract as ``trust_root.py``'s builders: pure functions, no session,
no request, no clock — every input, including ``now``, is passed in, so a
GET twice inside the same quantization bucket returns byte-identical bytes.

**Deliberate divergence from the spec's governance-key profile**
(security.mdx :1079: governance signing keys MUST be served from a separate
origin from transport/webhook keys). This deployment mints exactly one key
purpose (``MINTABLE_PURPOSES`` — request-signing), so the list is signed
with the tenant's REQUEST-SIGNING key, not a governance key. This is
self-consistent with our OWN consumer:
:class:`~src.core.signing.revocation.CounterpartyRevocationChecker` resolves
a published list's ``kid`` through the counterparty's request-signing JWKS,
so our own published list must be resolvable the same way. It is knowingly
NOT the governance profile — see the cross-reference at
``SigningKeyRepository.publishable_at``'s :1079 paragraph.

Closing that gap is a DEPLOYMENT decision, not a refactor: it needs a
governance key purpose in ``MINTABLE_PURPOSES``, key material minted for it,
and a genuinely SEPARATE publishing origin (a second origin is the point —
serving both purposes from one host satisfies the letter and none of the
intent, since an origin compromise then takes both). Until a deployment wants
that, signing with the request-signing key is the self-consistent choice, and
this docstring is the disclosure. Tracked on #1291.

**The list's retention is UNBOUNDED where the JWKS grace window is not.** A
kid dropped from ``revoked_kids`` is a kid UN-REVOKED — the schema never
permits removing an entry, only adding one — so this module reads
``SigningKeyRepository.all_revoked()`` (no grace cutoff, ever), never
``publishable_at()`` (which is deliberately time-bound).

    five layer decisions in an HTTP handler, each of which could be made differently by
    the next caller that needed this document.

    ``next_update`` is returned as an INSTANT, not as a cache lifetime. When the document
    goes stale is a property of the revocation interval — a domain fact, and the reason
