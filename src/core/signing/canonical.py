"""The URL-canonicalization seam: upstream's algorithm plus the comparer's rejection set.

#1291 B3 (``salesagent-z6nr.14``), re-scoped by ``salesagent-z6nr.33``. This module is
the layer's canonicalization surface. It delegates every canonical form to the VENDORED
upstream canonicalizer (:mod:`src.vendor.adcp_canonical` — adcp 7.0.2's implementation
copied verbatim, carrying the fixes the pinned ``adcp==6.6.0`` lacks) and adds exactly
one thing on top: the COMPARER-side rejection of raw non-ASCII hosts.

ONE vendored copy, not two. The pre-merge signing branch carried its own
``signing_contract/_upstream/canonical.py`` for the same reason #1721 added
``src/vendor/adcp_canonical``: 6.6.0 canonicalizes wrongly and 7.0.2 is not adoptable
yet. Two verbatim copies of one upstream file is the duplication class CLAUDE.md's DRY
invariant exists to prevent — and worse than usual here, because a signature base
computed by one copy and a format-id comparison made by the other would disagree
silently. The signing copy was deleted; this module is now the only caller-facing
surface over ``src/vendor/adcp_canonical``, which ``src.core.schemas._base`` already
reads for ``canonical_agent_url``.

This seam is PERMANENT; only its contents vary
----------------------------------------------
An earlier framing called this module a temporary workaround to be shrunk when the SDK
catches up. That framing coupled callers to SDK release timing — the exact coupling
the layer exists to remove. The stable property is the seam itself: callers get the
layer's canonicalization semantics and can never tell whether a behaviour came from the
SDK or from the vendored copy. When the pinned SDK ships the same fixes, the vendored
units are deleted and the delegation re-pointed (``salesagent-z6nr.28``) — and no
caller changes, which is the point.

Why it still must not re-derive
-------------------------------
Two independently-DERIVED canonicalizers in one verify path agree only by luck. The
vendored module does not violate that rule, because it is not a derivation: it is
upstream's own code, verbatim, provenance-cited, auditable by diff. This module NEVER
adds a third: it gates, then hands the string to the vendored canonicalizer.

What the comparer gate adds, and where each rule is grounded
------------------------------------------------------------
``adcontextprotocol/adcp@v3.1.1:docs/reference/url-canonicalization.mdx``
is the authoritative algorithm — security.mdx §"@target-uri canonicalization" defers
to it explicitly. The vendored canonicalizer enforces the step-3 malformed-authority
rejections and step 2's IPv6 rules itself (that IS the upstream fix). One rule differs
BY DESIGN between the signing and comparing sides:

* **step 2** — "A host containing raw non-ASCII bytes that has not been
  ToASCII-normalized by the producer MUST be rejected by the comparer — receivers do
  not silently re-normalize." The SIGNER-side obligation is the opposite: convert the
  U-label to its A-label (upstream's ``_canon_host`` does exactly that). This module
  sits on the comparer side, so it REJECTS before delegating. The predicate is shared
  (upstream's ``host_has_raw_non_ascii``); the decision is ours. One rule, one
  predicate, two sides.

The error code
--------------
``request_target_uri_malformed`` — the string ``canonicalization.json``'s six
``reject: true`` cases grade byte-for-byte. The vendored canonicalizer raises its own
``TargetUriMalformedError(ValueError)`` carrying it; this module re-raises everything
as the facade's :class:`TargetUriMalformedError`, which additionally subclasses the
SDK's ``SignatureVerificationError`` so BOTH caller populations keep their idiom: the
verifier's ``except SignatureVerificationError`` 401 path, and schema-land URL helpers
that treat a bad URL as a ``ValueError``. One public type, pinned by the
facade tests.

**It is NOT the same code as the wire-header rejection.** Request vector
``negative/026`` (non-ASCII ``Host`` on a signed request) legitimately expects
``request_signature_header_malformed`` — a verifier-checklist step-1 rejection. The two
are kept apart on purpose. What they SHARE is the predicate, not the code:
:func:`malformed_authority_reason` is the single source of the rule, called from here
with the canonicalization code and from
:func:`~src.core.signing.verifier._strict_header_precheck` with the checklist code.
One rule, two graded artifacts.

Note also that the vector README's worked example is STALE on this point — it shows the
reject cases expecting ``request_signature_header_malformed``. The shipped DATA wins;
do not "correct" the code from the prose.
