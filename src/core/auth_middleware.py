It reads nothing off the request and resolves nothing. Each transport hands its request
headers to the boundary, whose resolver is the one reader of a credential; this module

``WWW-Authenticate`` challenge beside it.

#: The challenge a 401 carries, per code.

#: RFC 6750 §3: a bearer challenge names the scheme and, when a credential WAS presented and
#: rejected, the ``invalid_token`` error code. Both credentials this seller accepts are
#: carried in ``Authorization: Bearer`` -- the only header this seller reads a credential
#: from -- so ``Bearer`` is the scheme to name. No ``realm``: AdCP defines none for this,
#: and RFC 7235
#: permits a challenge carrying the scheme alone.
#:
#: NOT the ``WWW-Authenticate: Signature error="..."`` family from L1/security.mdx's
#: "Transport error taxonomy" -- that is REQUEST SIGNING, a different mechanism with its own
#: codes. AUTH_MISSING and AUTH_INVALID are ordinary published codes from
#: ``enums/error-code.json`` and travel in the AdCP envelope as usual; what this adds is the
#: HTTP handshake beside it, which is what the storyboard's security_baseline grades.

    inside its integer-restoration decorator, and REST set the header in its exception
    handler. Three copies of "read the AdCP code, set 401, attach the challenge" is three
    places to edit and two places to forget.

    It is mounted app-wide rather than around one transport, so a NEW transport gets the
    same 401 for free and cannot render its own.

    It buffers, and it must: the ASGI ``http.response.start`` message carries the status and
    arrives BEFORE the body, so the status has to be held until the body has been seen. That
    is only sound for a finite response, which is why it buffers JSON alone (see
    ``_is_json_response``) and why the MCP app is built with ``json_response=True``. Under
    SSE this cannot work at all, and pretending otherwise is the mistake an earlier attempt
    made.

    It knows nothing about tools, and that is the point. Which tool was called, and whether
    that tool requires a caller, is decided where the name is actually available -- the
    boundary, which reads ``ToolSpec.requires_credential()`` and hands it to the resolver.
    A middleware cannot know it (the name is in the body) and must not guess it: a version
    of this that parsed the JSON-RPC body to find out was re-implementing the transport's
    own parsing and reading the registry a second time, which is the drift
    building-tools.md says the single declaration exists to prevent. This reads a CODE off
