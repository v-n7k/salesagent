"""Canonical payload hashing for idempotency replay-conflict detection.

The AdCP idempotency contract (the ``replay_ttl_seconds`` capability) defines
payload equivalence as RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme over the request
as sent, with a CLOSED exclusion list: two requests carrying the same
``idempotency_key`` and the same canonical hash are replays of each other; the
same key with a different canonical hash is an ``IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT``.

The hashing ENGINE is the SDK's ``adcp.server.idempotency`` canonicalizer
(strip the spec exclusion list → ``rfc8785`` → SHA-256) — the same algorithm
the reference implementation ships. This module is the single production seam
in front of it, deliberately:

- production code never imports the SDK module directly, so swapping the
  engine (back to a local implementation, or forward to a future SDK's) is a
  change to THIS file only;
- the RFC 8785 vectors in ``tests/unit/test_idempotency_canonical.py`` pin the
  BEHAVIOR against RFC-published bytes independently of who implements it — an
  SDK bump that changes hashing fails OUR vectors, and we choose;
- boundary translation stays ours: a pathologically nested payload raises a
  typed ``AdCPValidationError`` instead of the engine's raw ``RecursionError``.

``canonical_request_hash`` (model-dump indirection) exists so transport-
agnostic ``_impl`` bodies never call ``.model_dump()`` directly (the
no-model-dump-in-impl guard). It is the documented fallback for impl-direct
callers ONLY — transport wrappers thread the raw wire payload to
``canonical_payload_hash``, the spec's equivalence input.
