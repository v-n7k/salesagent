"""The one place a tool's WIRING is declared: which transports reach it, and what runs it.

A tool used to be declared between three and four times -- ``_register_tool`` in
``src/core/main.py``, an ``AgentSkill`` literal plus a ``skill_handlers`` row in the A2A
server, and a ``@router.post``/``@router.put`` decorator in ``src/routes/api_v1.py`` -- and
each declaration could disagree with the others. :data:`TOOLS` is the single declaration all
of them are now derived from; ``docs/development/building-tools.md`` is the design.

These rows are hand-written and therefore capable of being wrong. What makes them right is
that the transports are GENERATED from them: MCP registration loops this mapping, the A2A
card is ``_derived_skills()`` over it, A2A dispatch is ``_dispatch_skill`` validating a
parameter bag into ``TOOLS[name].dto``, and the REST router adds a route per ``rest``
binding. A row cannot disagree with a registration that is built from it.

:class:`ToolSpec` says where a tool is reachable and what runs it. It says nothing about the
tool's SHAPE -- the DTO says that itself, which is why ``dto`` is a reference to a model and
not a description of one.

    type: it was a
    second shape for a tool that already had one, taking no body, so a buyer could not send
    ``protocols``, ``context`` or ``ext`` that the same tool accepted everywhere else.

    satisfy it -- a coroutine is an ``Awaitable`` of the response -- and the boundary awaits

    ``Id`` is the identity type the implementation declared -- ``ResolvedIdentity`` for a

        - the implementation's identity annotation: ``ResolvedIdentity`` (or its

        - the SELLER's policy, when a ``tenant`` is given: a DTO that declares ``brand`` on
          a tenant whose ``brand_manifest_policy`` is ``require_auth`` needs a caller too
          (BR-UC-001 INV-1). The resolver asks with the tenant once it has loaded the row,
          so the refusal is minted there and nowhere else; without a tenant the answer is
          the annotation's alone, which is what the boundary uses to type the result.

        The row used to carry a required-or-optional ``auth`` literal beside the impl, which
        is a second statement of the same fact -- and a tool whose row said required while
        its body re-checked ``identity.principal`` for ``None`` was the symptom. Now the
        annotation is the policy, the resolver builds the type the annotation names, and the
        body reads the fields without a check.

        What it means is fixed by the pinned enum, ``3.1/enums/error-code.json``: AUTH_MISSING
        is "No credentials were presented. Sellers MUST return this code when no
        `Authorization` header was included in the request", and AUTH_INVALID is "Sellers MUST
        return this code when an `Authorization` header was present but verification failed".
        The second MUST names no task, so it is not this policy's to waive: the resolver
        refuses a rejected credential on every row. What this policy decides is the ABSENT
        credential only -- a protected tool refuses it (AUTH_MISSING), a public tool serves
        the caller anonymously, which is the case
        ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/universal/security.yaml`` sets aside ("public tasks like
