"""Get Media Buys tool implementation.

Returns media buy status, creative approval state, and optional delivery snapshots
for monitoring and reporting workflows.

Per-row failure policy
----------------------

Seller-side data corruption in one row has three possible outcomes, and picking one
takes two questions, in this order.

**1. Does the corrupt field have a legal absent value?** Its schema decides.

* OPTIONAL, so an empty value is legal: the row RENDERS with that value and the
  buyer is told on the ``errors[]`` advisory channel. ``targeting_overlay`` takes
  this path — ``None`` is a value the schema permits, and a silent ``None``,
  indistinguishable from "no targeting", is what the advisory exists to prevent.
  This answer is final; question 2 does not apply.
* REQUIRED, so nothing can be put there: the row cannot be rendered at all, and
  question 2 decides what happens instead. ``_persisted_revision`` and
  ``_compute_status`` raise ``AdCPPersistedStateError`` to signal this — a
  fabricated ``revision`` is a concurrency token nobody looked up, and a defaulted
  ``status`` is a lifecycle claim nobody defined.

**2. Did the buyer name this row?** ``_buyer_named_rows`` reads the request shape.

* NAMED it in ``media_buy_ids``: the read REFUSES, terminally, with the error that
  names the seller-side defect. Omitting the row here would answer "no such media
  buy" to a buyer who just asked about that specific one, which is a worse answer
  than an error they can escalate. Ruling R-M1; graded by
  ``@T-UC-019-boundary-revision``.
* Did NOT name it — an unfiltered listing: the row is OMITTED and an advisory
  naming its ``media_buy_id`` takes its place. One corrupt row must not deny a
  tenant every buy they own, and an advisory that does not say WHICH row went
  missing cannot be reconciled against. Graded by
  ``@T-UC-019-listing-omits-unrenderable-row``.

So: never fabricate a required field; never fail a whole listing over one row;
never answer "not found" when the buyer named the row that broke.

    THE RULE, stated at the altitude the defect actually lives at: **no value read out of
    an untyped persisted blob reaches a pinned constructor unresolved.** Not "the four
    package_config fields", and not "package_config" — that column is itself a roster, of
    blob columns. ``raw_request`` is the same kind of store and reaches
    ``GetMediaBuysMediaBuy`` the same way.

    The roster was wrong three times inside this one change before the rule was stated
    this way: a review named three fields and missed ``paused`` — which BOTH production
    constructors write while NO src/ site writes ``start_time``, so the list was ordered
    opposite to reachability — the rule then turned up ``targeting_overlay`` as a fifth,
    and a diff review turned up ``buyer_campaign_ref`` one frame up.

    FAILS CLOSED on a name the model does not declare. The first version validated with
    ``validate_assignment``, and ``GetMediaBuysPackage`` inherits ``extra="allow"`` from
    the SDK: assigning an undeclared name SET AN EXTRA and raised nothing, so the
    function returned the raw blob value with no advisory and no noise. A rule that
    fails open on an unknown name is a roster with extra steps — and the mismatch is not
    hypothetical, since this module already reads ``targeting`` into ``targeting_overlay``.
