"""The one path from a validated request to a response.

Every transport enters here. MCP, A2A and REST differ in how a request ARRIVES and how a
response is written back; between those two points there is one sequence, and this is it:
resolve the account the request names, honour the idempotency key it carries, run the
implementation.

## Why these two things live here and not in an implementation

Both are properties of the REQUEST rather than of the work. ``account`` names whose
inventory the caller is acting on; ``idempotency_key`` says "if you have already done this,
do not do it again". Neither is a step in creating a media buy or syncing a creative, and an
implementation that performs them has to be TOLD it is being called by a buyer. A value every
caller must remember to supply is a value some caller will forget, and a hash taken over
whatever each transport happened to hold makes "the same request" a per-transport answer.
Nothing internal passes through here, so an in-process call never inherits a caller's key.

## The idempotency rule, entire

Save a non-error response that carried a key. On a later request with the same key: same
payload replays it verbatim, different payload is IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT.

The digest is ``canonical_request_hash`` over the VALIDATED request -- ``req.model_dump``,
after the DTO has parsed it. Equivalence is therefore over the request as this seller
understands it: two spellings of one instant are one payload, and a field the pinned schema
does not define is dropped by ``extra="ignore"`` before hashing, so it cannot distinguish two
requests either. That is deliberate. What the seller deliberately discards cannot be part of
what it compares, and the alternative -- canonicalising the received bytes before validation
-- needs a capture point per transport, which is the arrangement whose failure this seam
exists to fix. On top of that the spec's closed exclusion list is stripped
(``idempotency_key``, ``context``, ``governance_context``, and
``push_notification_config.authentication.credentials``), so a key never hashes itself and a
rotated webhook credential does not turn a retry into a conflict.

Errors are never saved, and that is a property of control flow rather than a check: every
implementation RAISES on failure, and a raise never reaches the save. A returned result IS a
success.

Idempotency is scoped to (agent, account, key) per the spec, with no tool dimension.

## Failure

A failure is a RESPONSE. ``core/protocol-envelope.json`` declares ``adcp_error``, ``context``
and a required ``status`` on every response envelope, so what a transport writes for a refused
request is the same kind of object it writes for a served one. ``failure_response`` builds it
-- once, recording the fault first -- and ``_failed`` raises it as ``AdcpFailure``, the one
exception a transport catches. A transport adds only its marker: an HTTP status, a
``ToolError``, a Task state.
