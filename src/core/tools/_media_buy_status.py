"""Shared persisted-status resolver for the two required read tools.

``get_media_buy_delivery`` and ``get_media_buys`` each map the persisted
``MediaBuy.status`` column onto a wire status vocabulary, refining generic
serving states against the flight window. That map + date-refinement is ONE
logical operation (CLAUDE.md DRY invariant), so it lives here once instead of
being mirrored in two modules where the copies drifted (delivery dropped
unmapped rows; list showed them).

Canonical output vocabulary — the media-buy lifecycle taxonomy plus the
delivery-only terminal ``failed``::

    pending_creatives, pending_start, active, paused, completed,
    rejected, canceled, failed

(``get-media-buy-delivery-response.json`` status enum; AdCP spec 3.1.0-beta.3.)
The two callers adapt this single result to their own surface:

- ``get_media_buy_delivery`` uses the canonical string directly and overlays
  the webhook-only ``reporting_delayed`` when the reporting circuit breaker is
  open.
- ``get_media_buys`` collapses ``failed`` to ``rejected`` (the lifecycle enum
  has no ``failed``) and converts to ``MediaBuyStatus``.

Both use the SAME map and the SAME date-refinement, so a buy evaluated against
the SAME reference date gets the SAME status from either tool (pinned by
``tests/unit/test_media_buy_status_consistency.py``, which feeds both a shared
reference date). The two tools do NOT always pass the same reference date in
production, though: ``get_media_buys`` refines against *today*
(``media_buy_list.py``), while ``get_media_buy_delivery`` refines against the
request's *end_date* (``media_buy_delivery.py``) — current-state vs
period-scoped. So for a serving buy near its flight boundary the two may
legitimately report different date-refined statuses; the mapping is identical,
the reference date is the buyer-visible difference.

# Persisted ``MediaBuy.status`` -> canonical status. Written by

# rows so an existing buy is never dropped:
#   - "ready" / "scheduled": approved buys whose serving is purely date-gated —
#     they resolve to the generic serving state and date-refine exactly like
#     "active".
#   - "pending_activation": held un-promoted by the status scheduler until
#     creatives are approved (media_buy_status_scheduler.py), exactly like
#     "pending_start" — so it maps to "pending_start", NOT the serving state.
#     Date-refining it to "active" made a past-start buy with unapproved
#     creatives read as serving.
#   - "pending_approval" -> "pending_start" (INTERPRETATION, graded but not
#     spec-mandated): AdCP 3.1 has no "awaiting seller approval" wire status. Of
#     the two pre-serving states, pending_start ("ready to serve, waiting for its
#     flight date") is the closest — a buy the seller has yet to accept is not
#     "serving" and has no creatives gap to report (that is pending_creatives).
#     The literal reading of pending_start ("ready") slightly overstates an
#     awaiting-approval buy; the spec offers no better pre-serving bucket. If a
#     future spec adds an approval-queue status, revisit this row.
# The persisted->canonical projection and its value set live with the vocabulary
# in ``src.core.database.models``: mapping a persisted status to its wire word is a
# property of the vocabulary itself, not of this module's date refinement. Re-exported
# here because this module is where callers already look for them, and because
# ``resolve_canonical_status`` below is their only refinement.

    """Resolve a media buy's canonical status from its persisted column.

    The persisted ``MediaBuy.status`` is the source of truth. A generic serving
    state ("active"/"approved" and the legacy scheduled aliases) is refined
    against the flight window; a terminal/explicit state (paused, completed,
    rejected, canceled, failed) is returned verbatim.

    An *unmapped* persisted status is REFUSED, not described. It cannot be
    interpreted: the seller stored a lifecycle state that no rule defines, so any
    reading this function invented would be a claim about the buy that nobody made.
    It surfaces as ``AdCPPersistedStateError`` — ``CONFIGURATION_ERROR`` /
    ``terminal``, because the defect is in the seller's own store and the buyer has
    no lever on it and must not auto-retry. The write door refuses the same value
    through the same coercion, so the only way one reaches here is a row that
    predates the vocabulary or was written around the repository; the status
    -normalising migration beside ``7f3a1c9e2b04`` exists to empty that set.

    (History, so the refusal is not mistaken for the old bug: the delivery copy once
    passed unknown values THROUGH, which then failed its internal-status filter and
    made even fetch-by-ID report ``MEDIA_BUY_NOT_FOUND`` for a buy that exists. The
    fix for that was never "guess a serving state" — it was to stop the value
    entering.)

    Args:
        buy: A media buy exposing ``status``, ``start_date``/``end_date``,
            optional ``start_time``/``end_time``, and ``is_paused``.
        reference_date: The date the status is evaluated against (today, or the
            request's end date).
