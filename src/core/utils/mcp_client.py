"""Unified MCP client utility for consistent agent communication.

This module provides a single, standardized way to call MCP tools on
external agents (creative agents, signals agents, etc.).

Key features:
- Consistent URL handling (uses user's URL; if it fails after retries, does one
  final fallback attempt by appending "/mcp" when missing)
- Standardized auth header building
- Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff, driven by the shared
  egress Attempts machine — connect AND tool-call failures share ONE
  attempt sequence, so a transient tool-level failure is genuinely retried,
  not just classified after the fact
- Proper error handling and logging
- Testable in isolation

Usage:
    from src.core.utils.mcp_client import call_mcp_tool

    result = await call_mcp_tool(
        agent_url="https://example.com/mcp",
        tool="tool_name",
        arguments=params,
        auth={"type": "bearer", "credentials": "token123"},
        timeout=30,
    )
    payload = result.structured_content

    This is the ONLY place where MCP clients should be created. This ensures

    The connect AND the tool call live inside the SAME per-attempt ``try`` and
    drive the SAME :class:`~src.core.security.egress.attempts.Attempts`
    sequence, so a tool-level failure is retried exactly like a connect
    failure — the tool is re-invoked on the next attempt, not just reported
    once a connection later happens to succeed. The predecessor
    (``create_mcp_client``, an ``@asynccontextmanager``) could not offer this:
    its ``yield`` sat inside the retry ``try``, but the caller's
    ``client.call_tool(...)`` ran in the CALLER's own ``async with`` body,
    outside that ``try`` — a tool failure was thrown back into the generator
    at the yield and contextlib refused to resume it.
