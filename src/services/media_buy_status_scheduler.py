"""Media Buy Status Scheduler - Automatically transitions media buy statuses.

This scheduler runs in the background and updates media buy statuses based on
their flight dates:
- pending_activation -> active (when start_time has passed and creatives approved)
- scheduled -> active (when start_time has passed)
- active -> completed (when end_time has passed)

This ensures media buys don't get stuck in transitional states when approved
before their start date.
