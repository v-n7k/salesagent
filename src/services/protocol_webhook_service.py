"""Sender for AdCP task-status webhooks.

Every notification this service delivers is one ``mcp-webhook-payload`` envelope,
because every registration it delivers against arrived through the AdCP channel --
``push_notification_config`` in the task arguments, or ``reporting_webhook`` on
``create_media_buy``. AdCP 3.1.1 ``L3/webhooks.mdx`` § "Registration channel
determines envelope shape" (:308) makes that the rule: the envelope follows the
registration mechanism, and the page names keying on the sync transport as the
model it is NOT ("Why this is the model, not 'match inbound transport'", :328).
The A2A-native channel that would ask for a ``Task`` -- ``TaskPushNotificationConfig``
-- is not implemented here at all.
