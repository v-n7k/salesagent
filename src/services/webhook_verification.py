"""Webhook signature verification reference for AdCP webhook receivers.

Delegates entirely to ``adcp.webhook_receiver.verify_webhook_hmac`` (the
installed ``adcp==6.6.0`` SDK), which verifies the HMAC over the RAW body
bytes as received — never a re-serialization of a parsed payload. Per AdCP
3.1.1 (``docs/building/by-layer/L3/webhooks.mdx:404-418``):
"Verifiers MUST use the raw HTTP body bytes as received on the wire,
captured before any JSON parse or re-serialize." A verifier that
re-serializes a parsed dict (this module's own prior implementation)
recreates, on the receive side, the exact signed-bytes-vs-wire-bytes
divergence #1441 fixes on the send side — and masks it, because
a re-serializing verifier and a re-serializing signer can agree with each
other while both disagree with the real wire.

This is a reference implementation for AdCP webhook *receivers* — this
application is a sender, not a receiver, and has no inbound webhook route in
``src/`` today (salesagent-47n9.19's disease scan confirmed zero production
callers of this module). The duplicate-object-key rejection below is
conformance work for that reference, graded by the vendored spec vectors, not
production ingress policy.

class WebhookBodyMalformedError(WebhookVerificationError):
    """Raised when a webhook's signature verifies but the body is malformed.

    Sits in the AdCP hierarchy under :class:`WebhookVerificationError`, so it
    inherits that class's ``AUTH_INVALID`` code. Neither class can reach a
    transport boundary today (no production caller, no inbound route — see
    module docstring), so nothing derives a wire envelope from that code yet,
    and the spec explicitly leaves error-carrier internals
    implementation-defined. The only property any caller depends on is the one
    below: that a malformed body is a DISTINCT class from a signature failure.
    Should this reference ever gain an inbound route, this class needs its own
    non-auth code — a body that is malformed AFTER a valid signature is not a
    credential rejection.

    Distinct from a bare :class:`WebhookVerificationError` (signature
    mismatch, bad timestamp, malformed header) per AdCP 3.1.1
    L1/security.mdx §Duplicate object keys: *"the signature IS valid; the
    body is malformed"* — verifier checklist step 14 names this identifier
    ``webhook_body_malformed``, distinct from

        Returns:
            The parsed JSON payload once the signature verifies and the body
            contains no duplicate object key at any depth. If ``body`` is not
            a JSON OBJECT at all — not valid JSON, or valid JSON that parses
            to something other than an object (a top-level array, a scalar,
            the literal ``null``) — ``None`` is returned instead. Duplicate-
            key detection only applies to objects, so this method does not
            require the body to be JSON, or JSON-object-shaped, to succeed;
            it only adds the duplicate-key MUST on top of signature
            verification for the bodies that are.

            Returning the parsed payload (rather than ``True``) eliminates a
            double-parse: this method used to instruct callers to
            "parse the body again" after verification, which is a second,
            independent parse of the same bytes — exactly the
            parser-differential shape AdCP 3.1.1's duplicate-key rule cites
            CVE-2017-12635 to warn against (a verifier and a business-logic
            parser disagreeing about what a body means). This return-type
            change is NOT required by the duplicate-key MUST itself — a
            ``bool`` return with an internal raise-on-duplicate would already
            satisfy "reject after HMAC succeeds" — it is adopted to close
            that separate parser-differential risk.

            WebhookVerificationError: Signature, timestamp, or header format
