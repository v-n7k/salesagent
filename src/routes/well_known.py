"""The four trust-root/governance documents, served per Host (#1291 A3/A5).

``/.well-known/brand.json``, ``/.well-known/adagents.json``,
``/.well-known/jwks.json`` (A3, salesagent-z6nr.9) and
``/.well-known/governance-revocations.json`` (A5 follow-up,
salesagent-z6nr.27). Plain GETs, no auth, no signature (the first three
carry no signature of their own; the last one is ITSELF a JWS, signed, but
still served unauthenticated): these documents BOOTSTRAP the trust chain,
so requiring the signature they exist to let a verifier check would
deadlock every counterparty. Nothing has to EXEMPT these paths for that to
hold: inbound verification runs inside ``_resolve_identity`` behind the tool
boundary (``src/core/resolved_identity.py``), not in a middleware, and a
plain router GET never reaches that boundary.

Each request resolves its tenant from the Host the way every other
host-routed surface does (:func:`route_landing_page`), then RE-READS that
tenant through the repository layer inside ONE :class:`TrustRootUoW` — the
routing result is a dict, and the identity helpers take the ORM model.

**The builder seam is NARROWED, not widened, by the fourth document.** Only
the revocation-list handler ever resolves signing MATERIAL (a private-key
decrypt under the deployment KEK) — a structural guard
(``tests/unit/test_architecture_well_known_material_isolation.py``) pins
that exactly one named function in this module calls
``resolve_signing_material``/``_resolve_signing_provider``. The other three
handlers read only what they already read: ``publishable_at()`` and (for
adagents.json) the authorized-property records. Each handler is its own
closure over the shared ``(uow, tenant, now)`` — none receives a parameter
it discards, unlike the three-argument union shape this module used before
the fourth document.

The anti-drift guarantee this module provides is that all four handlers
call the SAME ``publishable_at()`` / ``all_revoked()`` methods with the SAME
``grace_seconds`` — not that one shared read backs all four documents in one
request. Each document is built in its own request, its own UoW, and its own
``now``; brand.json and jwks.json are never the same HTTP response.

Every DB read is dispatched with ``asyncio.to_thread`` — these are
synchronous calls on an async route, and blocking the event loop on an
unauthenticated endpoint is a denial-of-service surface. The three
secret-free documents serve unconditionally at any Host, including
``http://localhost`` — this module never consults ``origin_is_publishable``,
exactly as before the fourth document existed.
