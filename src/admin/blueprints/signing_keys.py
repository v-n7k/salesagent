"""Signing-key management blueprint (#1291, salesagent-7x8t).

The admin transport over ``src.core.signing.keys.provision_signing_key`` — the
ONE function that may mint a ``signing_keys`` row. ``scripts/ops/provision_signing_key.py``
is the second transport over the same function; neither contains provisioning
logic of its own.

Every read and write goes through ``SigningKeyUoW``, shaped on
``src/admin/blueprints/accounts.py``. ``principals.py`` mints per-tenant secrets
with ``get_db_session()`` and raw model kwargs; that is allowlisted pre-existing
debt, not a pattern to copy.

Provisioning is safe to run from a request handler here precisely BECAUSE nothing
is written to a filesystem: the private half is stored on the row as ciphertext
under the deployment KEK. That is what separates this from the deferred defect at
``gcp_service_account_service.py`` (credentials written to the OS temp dir from a
request handler, ``salesagent-dmqk``).

A refusal — no KEK configured, a scheme this deployment forbids — is a flash
error on the list page, never a 500: it is an operator-correctable configuration
state, and a stack trace tells the operator nothing about which knob to set.
