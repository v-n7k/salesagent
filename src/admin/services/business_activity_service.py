"""Business Activity Service - Shows meaningful business events.

This service generates activity feed items focused on business-relevant events:
- Product inquiries (searches, recommendations)
- Media buy lifecycle (created, approved, launched, completed)
- Actions needed (approvals, creative reviews)
- Performance alerts (underdelivering, budget concerns)

NOT raw audit logs of every API call.
