    transports. ``description`` comes from the pinned SDK, the same source MCP registration
    reads. ``tags`` come off the DTO (``DTO.TAGS``): the SDK carries none, so they are ours,
    but they describe the tool's shape like the field descriptions beside them rather than
    its wiring -- so they sit with the shape, not in the registry.

    A tool whose DTO declares no TAGS contributes none. That is not an omission to fix: the
    three task tools have never been on A2A, so nobody has written tags for them, and
    inventing some here would be a declaration this file is not entitled to make.
