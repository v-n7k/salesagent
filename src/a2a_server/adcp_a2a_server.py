        A2A lets a buyer attach a webhook to a skill invocation through
        ``params.configuration.task_push_notification_config``. AdCP defines no such channel
        — a webhook is a declared field of the AdCP request itself, ``push_notification_config``
        on the tool's own schema, which on this transport travels in the DataPart like every
        other request field. So the A2A push-notification capability is declined WHOLESALE:
        the agent card advertises ``push_notifications=False`` (``create_agent_card``, :571)
        and the four ``tasks/pushNotificationConfig/*`` methods above refuse.

        This envelope field was the one entry point that did neither. ``on_message_send``
        read ``params.message.parts`` and nothing else, so a registration sent here was
        silently DROPPED: the buyer received 200 for a webhook that was never registered.
        Worse, since the config never reached the validated request, neither the
        security.mdx @ v3.1.1 :1464 log duty nor the :1465 signature escalation ran for a
        payload carrying ``authentication`` — the two obligations the AdCP field triggers on
        every transport, including this one. Dropping and declining are indistinguishable
        from inside this agent and opposite from outside it.

        REFUSING, not threading it into the skill's parameters. Merging it would build an
        AdCP registration channel out of a transport-specific one, which is precisely what
        declining the capability decided against; refusing says what the agent card already
        said. A buyer that wants a webhook on this seller declares it in the AdCP request.
