# tests/harness/ is NOT optional here: tox's `unit` env runs
# `pytest tests/unit/ tests/harness/`, so anything under tests/harness/ was
# graded ONLY by a full-suite run and was invisible to the per-change gate.
# That gap is not theoretical -- tests/harness/test_forward_compat_acceptance.py
# went red on 2026-08-13 and stayed red across 47 commits and 4+ days, because
# every per-bead `make quality` ran a path that did not contain it. Keep this
# target's scope identical to tox's unit env.
