# Signing posture and key discovery

For counterparties integrating with this sales agent. It covers what we advertise about
RFC 9421 message signing, what each declaration means for your requests, and how to find
the public key that verifies our signatures.

Companion pages: [Verifying our outbound webhooks](verifying-our-webhooks.md) and the
operator-facing [signing key runbook](../operations/signing-key-runbook.md).

AdCP spec version: **3.1.1** (see [adcp-spec-version.md](../adcp-spec-version.md)).

## What we advertise

`get_adcp_capabilities` carries three signing-related blocks. Each is honest about the
key material actually present — a tenant with no usable signing key advertises that it
cannot sign, rather than advertising a posture it could not honour.

| Block | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `request_signing` | Whether we VERIFY signatures on requests you send us, and for which operations |
| `webhook_signing` | Whether we SIGN the webhooks we send you |
| `identity` | Where our trust root lives — `brand_json_url` is the anchor for the walk below |

The same honesty governs `identity`. An origin that cannot carry a publicly-resolvable
https trust root — a localhost or single-label host in a development deployment — omits
`brand_json_url` and `key_origins` rather than naming documents nothing can fetch, and
`key_origins` is omitted whenever no publishable key exists. We never advertise a JWKS
pointer whose document would answer `{"keys": []}`.

### The enforcement ladder

`request_signing` grades every operation into exactly one bucket:

| Bucket | What happens to an unsigned request |
|---|---|
| not listed | Passes. The operation is outside the posture entirely. |
| `supported_for` | Passes. We verify a signature if you send one, and we accept the request if you do not. |
| `required_for` | Rejected. |

Two buckets, and there is no third. The pinned schema also defines `warn_for`, which serves a
signed-but-INVALID request as though it were fine; we do not implement it, and a declaration
naming it is refused. It would tell you your signing works when it does not, and you could not
tell the difference from the outside — so the only shadow mode we offer is `supported_for`,
where a broken signature is refused and a missing one is not.

Three more rules matter when you read a declaration:

- **An absent `supported_for` is not an empty one.** If we declare `supported: true` and
  supply no `supported_for` list at all, every operation sits in `supported` — we verify a
  signature wherever one appears. An explicit list narrows that to the operations named,
  and only then does "not listed" mean "outside the posture".
- **`supported: false` collapses every bucket to "none".** If we advertise that we do not
  verify signatures, no operation is required regardless of what the other fields say.
  Check `supported` first.
- **JSON-RPC methods are not graded at all.** The pinned schema defines
  `protocol_methods_supported_for` / `_warn_for` / `_required_for` for wire methods such as
  `tasks/cancel`. We declare none of them and refuse a declaration that names one: those
  methods are answered by the transport SDK below AdCP dispatch and never reach the verifier,
  so a posture naming them would be a promise nothing keeps. The one such method worth
  protecting — `tasks/pushNotificationConfig/set`, which registers a webhook and its
  credentials — we decline outright; webhook configuration reaches us only as a field of an
  AdCP request body, signed like any other body.

### `covers_content_digest`

Declares whether our verifier requires the `content-digest` component to be covered by
your signature. We advertise `either`, the schema default: we accept a signature that covers
it and one that does not.

Cover it anyway. Every request you send us is a `POST` to one path, so `@method`,
`@target-uri` and `@authority` are identical across all of them — a signature that omits
`content-digest` proves you hold the key and says nothing about what you sent, and an on-path
mutator can change the body without breaking it. The reason we advertise `either` rather than
`required` is the conformance corpus, not a judgement about that risk: eleven of AdCP's twelve
positive request-signing vectors sign without `content-digest`, so a verifier declaring
`required` refuses the spec's own happy path. Recorded in
[the subset design note](../design/request-signing-subset.md).

### Signature freshness

Our verifier enforces two bounds on the `created` and `expires` parameters:

| Bound | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| clock skew | 60 s | How far your clock may differ from ours before a signature is refused |
| validity window | 300 s | The longest signature lifetime we accept, the spec ceiling |

A signature with a window longer than we accept is refused even if it has not expired.
Sign close to the moment you send.

### Algorithms

We mint and verify `ed25519` and `ecdsa-p256-sha256`. `ed25519` is the default for keys
we provision.

## Key discovery

**A bare `.well-known/jwks.json` lookup is NOT the discovery mechanism.** This is the
documented trap, and it fails in a way that looks like success: the URL usually exists
and usually returns a JWKS, so a verifier built on it appears to work right up until it
is pointed at an agent whose keys live elsewhere, or until a key rotation it has no way
to learn about. The JWKS is the last hop of a chain, not the entry point.

The chain is anchored on what we advertise, so it can never point at a document we do not
control:

1. **`get_adcp_capabilities` → `identity.brand_json_url`.** The spec pins this to
   `^https://`; an agent that cannot serve https cannot declare one, and therefore cannot
   participate in signed exchange at all.
2. **`brand_json_url` → brand.json.** Served at `<origin>/.well-known/brand.json`. The
   origin is our canonical agent origin — scheme and host, no path. brand.json and the
   agent always share an origin: the Brand Agent variant of the document has no
   `authorized_operators[]` escape hatch, so the two cannot legitimately diverge.
3. **brand.json → `agents[].jwks_uri` → JWKS.** Served at
   `<origin>/.well-known/jwks.json`. This is the document that is authoritative for
   request signatures and for operator-side webhook signatures.

Concretely, for an agent reachable at `https://seller.example.com`:

```
get_adcp_capabilities  ->  identity.brand_json_url = "https://seller.example.com/.well-known/brand.json"
                       ->  agents[].jwks_uri       = "https://seller.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
                       ->  {"keys": [{"kty": "OKP", "crv": "Ed25519", "alg": "EdDSA",
                                      "use": "sig", "key_ops": ["verify"],
                                      "adcp_use": "request-signing", "kid": "...", "x": "..."}]}
```

`agents[].url` in brand.json is the same origin plus the transport's endpoint path
(`/mcp/` or `/a2a`) — the exact strings the running app resolves to after any redirect it
issues.

### adagents.json is a different document for a different question

`<publisher-domain>/.well-known/adagents.json` carries
`authorized_agents[].signing_keys[]`. It is a **publisher-side pin**, authoritative for
exactly one thing: sell-side webhook delivery. **It is not in the request-signing chain.**
Do not substitute it for the brand.json walk, and do not treat its absence as a signal
about request signing.

Both documents are built from one query against the same publishable key set, so the pin
and the JWKS cannot drift into disagreeing about which keys exist.

### Caching

brand.json, adagents.json and the JWKS carry an explicit `Cache-Control: max-age=300`.
Publishing it ourselves stops an intermediate proxy inventing a TTL of its own and masking
a rotation from you. Honour it: caching longer means a rotation reaches you late, and
caching not at all means a request-rate of key fetches you do not need. The revocation
list below derives its own max-age from its `next_update` instead of taking the fixed 300.

### Revoked keys stay published, and carry a marker

A revoked key remains in the JWKS for a grace period rather than disappearing
immediately, so a verifier whose cache has not yet refreshed still finds the key **and
can see that it was revoked**. The revocation marker travels with the key into both
brand.json and the JWKS.

This places an obligation on you: **a key carrying a revocation marker must not be
trusted**, even though it is present in a document you fetched successfully. A JWKS entry
without the marker is indistinguishable from a live key, which is precisely why we carry
it rather than omitting the key.

### The combined revocation list

The grace window ends; the revocation record does not. Permanent revocations are published
as a signed document at `<origin>/.well-known/governance-revocations.json` — the same
origin as brand.json, which is where we look for yours. It carries `issuer`, `version`,
`updated`, `next_update` and `revoked_kids`, wrapped in a JWS general-JSON serialization
whose `kid` resolves through the JWKS you already fetched.

Three properties to build against:

- **`revoked_kids` only grows.** A kid dropped from the list is a kid un-revoked, so
  entries never age out. The JWKS grace window is time-bounded; this list is not.
- **`updated` and `next_update` are quantized onto the publication interval**, so two
  fetches inside one interval return byte-identical bytes and a poll sees no spurious
  change. Refresh at `next_update`.
- **The list is signed with our request-signing key**, not a separate governance key. The
  spec's governance profile asks for a separate origin; a deployment that mints only the
  request-signing purpose has no second key to sign with, so the list is verifiable
  through the same JWKS as everything else. The divergence is deliberate and disclosed,
  not silent.

If no active request-signing key resolves, the endpoint returns 404. That is a withdrawal
of the list, and distinguishable from a list that exists and names nothing.

## Enrolling for a pilot

1. Publish your own trust root and tell us your agent URL. We resolve you by the same
   walk described above — your `brand_json_url`, your JWKS — so an agent that cannot be
   discovered cannot be enrolled.

   **Serve your JWKS at `<your agent origin>/.well-known/jwks.json`.** We read keys from
   that one location and nowhere else. The spec makes it the default and lets
   `agents[].jwks_uri` name somewhere else instead; we decline that half, so a brand.json
   pointing its keys at another origin or another path is refused with
   `request_signature_jwks_untrusted` naming the location we looked at. One location means
   your key location cannot go stale in a document we cached, which is the whole reason —
   see [the subset design note](../design/request-signing-subset.md).
2. We add your operations to `supported_for`. Send signed requests; unsigned ones still
   pass. A signature that fails is refused from this point, which is what makes the stage
   worth running: you find out immediately, rather than being told everything is fine.
3. We promote to `required_for` once your signed traffic is clean. From this point unsigned
   requests to those operations are rejected.

Rollback from step 3 is a per-tenant configuration change on our side, not a deploy — see
the [runbook](../operations/signing-key-runbook.md#rollback). If your integration breaks
after promotion, tell us; the fix does not require a release.
