#
# Runs the test suites INSIDE the compose network instead of on the host. The
# runner container reaches Postgres and the app server by SERVICE NAME
# (postgres:5432, proxy:8000), so this path publishes NO host ports and cannot
# hit the host-port TOCTOU race that scripts/test-stack.sh suffers when it
# guesses a free port in 50000-60000 and a sibling stack grabs it before
# `docker up` binds it.
#
# Each `docker compose -p <project>` gets its own isolated bridge network, so
# `postgres`/`proxy` here can never collide with another stack's — many of these
# can run concurrently with zero port coordination.
#
# STATUS — all six suites run in-network, addressing every dependency by SERVICE
# NAME (postgres:5432, proxy:8000, creative-agent:8080, runner alias `tests`):
#   unit              -> no DB (DATABASE_URL unset by the unit tox env)

#                        Dockerfile.test; browser drives proxy:8000
#
# Per-suite DB split: integration/bdd/admin use the runner's DATABASE_URL
# (/adcp_test); e2e/ui override it to E2E_DATABASE_URL (/adcp) in their tox envs.

# the dir but not write into it, and every suite dies at collection with
# `PermissionError: '/app/logs/audit.log'`. Owning it here first means
# adcp-server writes into an already-correct dir instead of racing to
# create it (confirmed live: sa-93d37d7c, sa-c9acaf66 both landed
# drwxr-sr-x -- not group-writable -- and are latent failures until fixed).
# This must stay ahead of the TLS step below too: that step's fallback runs a
# `tests` container, which would otherwise be the one to create logs/ first --
# which is why this block sits ABOVE the TLS/subnet steps rather than beside
# the `dc up` it used to precede.

# uid fails with EPERM, and a bare `chmod` here would abort the whole script
# under `set -e` -- so tolerate the failure, but do NOT assume it worked. The
# verification below is what turns a still-broken state into a diagnosable
# error instead of a collection-time PermissionError 200 lines later.

# The setgid bit above fixes the GROUP of files created in here, but NOT their
# write bit -- that comes from the creating process's umask, and adcp-server's
# yields 0644. So a FRESH logs/ still ends up with `-rw-r--r-- ci:ci`
# audit.log, and the tests container (a different uid in the same `ci` group)
# dies at collection with `PermissionError: '/app/logs/audit.log'`. The
# `chmod -R g+w .` backstop further down cannot repair it either: it runs as
# the sync user, which does not OWN a ci-created file, so the chmod fails and
# is swallowed by its `2>/dev/null || true`. Pre-create the files ourselves so
# the server APPENDS to an already-group-writable file instead of creating one
# with its own umask. Runs before every `dc up`/`dc run` for the same reason
# the mkdir does. (Observed live: sa-067cc4a9 failed exactly this way on a
# fresh run dir, while sa-858f3b3a passed only because it inherited a stale
# 0664 logs/ from an earlier run -- i.e. this was always latent, and green
# runs were green by accident.)
# rm first, then recreate: on a REUSED run directory the existing files are
# owned by the server's uid, so `touch` (needs write) and `chmod` (needs
# ownership) both fail on them -- and under `set -e` that would abort the whole
# script. Unlinking works regardless of file ownership because it is the
# DIRECTORY's write bit that governs it, and we own the directory. These are
# per-run scratch logs, so discarding a previous run's copy costs nothing.
# The list is exactly what src/core/audit_logger.py opens: audit.log (its
# FileHandler), error.log (its error FileHandler), and the two append-mode

# Copy ONLY the suites THIS invocation ran, and name them EXPLICITLY -- never a
# wholesale `*.json` glob. On the volume shape a wholesale glob cannot pick up a
# PREVIOUS run's report (the volume is created and `down -v`-destroyed per run,
# and COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME is unique per run), so this is not about cross-run
# staleness here. It is about the case the glob structurally cannot report: a
# suite that RAN and died before writing its JSON. A glob copies what exists and
# says nothing about what does not, so a dead suite leaves an omission that reads
# as "that suite simply wasn't in this run".
#
# That failure mode is not hypothetical in the sibling host shape, where `.tox`
# IS a persistent directory: `storyboard` is an opt-in env (not in tox's

# consecutive runs published a storyboard.json from hours earlier, and the
# numbers were read as this run's until an SDK version inside the report
# contradicted the SDK that was actually installed. Naming the suites closes
# both directions at once and keeps the two runners' contracts the same.

#
# The per-suite selection runs INSIDE the extraction container, against the
# volume. Deliberately not a host-side `[ -f ".tox/$s.json" ]` test: the host's
# ./.tox is empty under the volume shape, so a host-side existence check would
# declare EVERY suite missing -- and if a developer's earlier host `tox` run left

# filesystem, and the only filesystem that holds this run's reports is /t.
# stdout carries the missing-suite list; the container's stderr passes straight

#
# The dispatched-request payload artifacts (tests/bdd/payload_capture.py), one per

# reads every later run as CLEAN.
