# Handoff: fixing the four request-signing conformance bugs in `adcp-client-python`

**For:** an agent working in `adcontextprotocol/adcp-client-python`.
**From:** #1291 B3 in `prebid/salesagent`, which found all four by RUNNING the shipped conformance
data against `adcp==6.6.0`.

This note says what order to fix the four issues (#976, #977, #978, #979) in, why that order, and
where working code already exists.

## Status against this repo's merged tree

All four were open and unfixed when this was measured against `adcp==6.6.0`. Since then `adcp` 7.0.2
shipped the canonicalization half — it passes **37 of 37** published URL-canonicalization vectors
where 6.6.0 fails 14 — which closes **#977, #978 and #979**. This repo cannot take that pin yet
(7.0.2 forces `mcp` 2.x and replaces `Creative.format_id` with `format_kind` + `format_option_ref`,
measured at 571 broken unit tests; that migration is `salesagent-3xcdk`), so it vendors 7.0.2's two
canonicalization modules byte-for-byte at `src/vendor/adcp_canonical/` — one repointed sibling import
is the only edit — and deletes the directory when the pin lands.

**#976 is still open and still ours.** It is a wire-header rejection at verifier-checklist step 1,
not a canonicalization rejection, and nothing in 7.0.2 touches it.

Read §§0–1 as the record of how each was found and ordered; read §2's pointers as they now stand.

## 0. Before anything: land #980

**PR #980 vendors the complete 3.1.1 request-signing vector set and pins it against drift. Nothing
else here should merge before it.**

That is not a preference. Issue #975 is precisely that the vendored vectors are incomplete *and the
loaders cannot detect it* — so today a fix for #977 or #979 would merge with nothing upstream
grading it. Fixing a conformance bug in a repo that cannot run the conformance data reproduces the
defect that allowed the bug. #980 is approved at 19/20; land it, then everything below has an oracle.

Once it is in, the two files that matter are:

- `test-vectors/request-signing/canonicalization.json` — **31 cases**, of which **8 fail** on
  `adcp==6.6.0`. These grade #977, #978 and #979.
- `test-vectors/request-signing/negative/{021,022,023,026}.json` — these grade #976.

Every case carries `expected_target_uri` / `expected_authority` (positive) or `reject: true` plus an
error code (negative). Assert byte-for-byte. Include each case's `rule` string in the assertion
message so a failure names the canonicalization step that broke.

---

## 1. Order, and why

*Historical: this is the ordering as reasoned when all four were open. Three of them have since
landed in 7.0.2 — see the status section above — and #976 is what remains.*

### #978 first — malformed authorities + the missing constant

**Why first:** it introduces `request_target_uri_malformed`. #977's U-label rejection raises *the
same code*. Do #977 first and you either invent a second constant or block. #978 also carries the
largest behavioural surface — five authority shapes currently accepted that the spec says MUST be
rejected — so it is the fix that moves the most cases green.

**Cases it turns green:** all 6 `reject: true` cases. Five are accepted outright today; the sixth,
`malformed-ipv6-missing-closing-bracket`, is refused by `urlsplit` with a **bare `ValueError`
carrying no code**, so it fails on the wrong exception type rather than passing. Normalising that
into the typed error is part of the fix, not a detail — a test that accepts any exception would pass
today and prove nothing.

### #977 second — IDNA A-label conversion and raw U-label rejection

Depends on #978's constant. Two cases: `idn-to-punycode`, `idn-mixed-case-to-punycode`.

**The subtlety that decides the whole design:** these are **producer-side**. `url-canonicalization.mdx`
step 2 is explicit — *"A host containing raw non-ASCII bytes that has not been ToASCII-normalized by
the producer MUST be rejected by the comparer — receivers do not silently re-normalize."* So the
verifier path must **reject**, not convert. A comparer that re-normalizes picks one of several
legitimate UTS-46 outcomes and disagrees with whoever signed. The **signer** path is where the
conversion belongs.

Note the SDK already has `adcp.signing._idna_canonicalize.canonicalize_host`, and **four sibling
modules call it** — `_canon_authority` simply never does. Much of #977 may be wiring an existing
helper into the signer path rather than writing new IDNA logic. Check that before writing anything.
The pin is UTS-46 Nontransitional with `CheckHyphens` / `CheckBidi` / `UseSTD3ASCIIRules`.

### #976 third — step-1 structured-field rejection

Independent of the other three; only third because it is a different code path and the two above
share a constant. Do it in parallel if you have the hands.

**Cases:** `negative/021`, `022`, `023`, `026`. Measured behaviour on `adcp==6.6.0`:

| vector | expects | SDK returns today | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 021 duplicate `Signature-Input` dict key | `request_signature_header_malformed` | `request_signature_components_incomplete` | the RFC 8941 parser last-wins on the duplicate key |
| 022 multi-valued covered non-list field | `request_signature_header_malformed` | `request_signature_invalid` | no single-value check on a covered non-list field |
| 023 multi-valued `Content-Digest` | `request_signature_header_malformed` | `request_signature_invalid` | no RFC 9530 duplicate-algorithm check |
| 026 non-ASCII `Host` | `request_signature_header_malformed` | `request_signature_invalid` | no A-label enforcement on the authority path |

**Note 026 expects a DIFFERENT code from the canonicalization reject set**, even though the
underlying rule is the same. A wire-header rejection is checklist step 1
(`request_signature_header_malformed`); a canonicalization rejection is
`request_target_uri_malformed`. Share the *predicate*, never the code. Collapsing them loses a graded
artifact in each direction.

### #979 last — trailing empty query

One case, `trailing-empty-query-preserved`: `canonicalize_target_uri` drops a trailing `?`, so `/p?`
and `/p` produce the same signature base. Smallest surface, no dependencies, and the one least
likely to be observable to most callers — see §3 on why we could not grade it at all.

---

## 2. Where to take the code from

`prebid/salesagent`, branch `feat/rfc9421-on-1721`. Every rule below is spec-cited line by line and
graded by the same conformance data you will be running.

### For #978, #977, #979 — nothing left to take

These three are merged in 7.0.2, and the copy in this repo IS your merged code:
`src/vendor/adcp_canonical/canonical.py` is 7.0.2 verbatim. What this repo once carried by hand —
`_malformed_authority_reason` (steps 2–3: userinfo-but-no-host, no host at all, bracketed host
missing its closing bracket, bare IPv6 outside brackets, IPv6 zone identifier), `_bracketed_host_reason`,
`_split_or_reject`'s normalisation of `urlsplit`'s bare `ValueError`, and the
`REQUEST_TARGET_URI_MALFORMED` constant — is all upstream's own now. Two properties of that code are
worth not losing in a later refactor: the rule returns a **reason string rather than a bool**, so
every caller's message names the rule that fired; and the gate lives *inside*
`canonicalize_target_uri` / `canonicalize_authority` rather than wrapped around them.

**One rule deliberately stays on the consumer side** and should not be pushed upstream:
`src/core/signing/canonical.py::malformed_authority_reason` adds the raw-non-ASCII-host rejection on
top of the vendored predicate, because that rejection is comparer-only — upstream's `_canon_host`
must keep CONVERTING the U-label on the signer path (§1, #977). One predicate, two sides, two
decisions. The rest of that module is a seam: `reject_malformed_target` gates, `_delegated` folds the
vendored rejections onto one public type, and `producer_target_uri` is the ungated signer-side entry
point.

### For #976 — `src/core/signing/verifier.py::_strict_header_precheck`

Plus its companion table `_MALFORMED_VALUE_RULES` and `_SINGLE_LINE_SIGNED_HEADERS`.

**The one thing to carry across above all else:** it runs over the **raw header list**
(`tuple[tuple[bytes, bytes], ...]` as received), never a collapsed dict. Every dict view of headers **last-wins** on a
repeated name rather than joining it. The vectors express "multi-valued" as a single comma-joined
value, so a gate written over the dict passes all four vectors while missing the threat their own
`$comment`s describe: a proxy inserting a **second header line**, which last-wins before any check
runs. We grade both forms of each shape for exactly this reason.

The rules are a **predicate table**, not an if-chain — that is what lets the authority rule have one
definition shared with the canonicalization gate while raising a different code at each site.

---

## 3. The cases we could NOT grade, and what that means for you

Our verifier accounts for all 31 canonicalization cases with **0 skipped and 0 xfailed**. **29 run as
conformance through the layer's public surface; 2 run as named blocker tests**, because they are not
observable at a verifier boundary at all:

- **the two IDN cases (#977)** — `idn-to-punycode` and `idn-mixed-case-to-punycode` are producer-side,
  per step 2 above. A comparer can only reject, so the blocker tests assert the rejection; neither
  pins the SDK's current output, because a test that pins today's wrong answer locks the bug in.

`trailing-empty-query-preserved` (#979) **graduated to conformance** once 7.0.2's fix was vendored:
the seam receives URL strings and now preserves the trailing `?`. The asymmetry that originally hid
it is still real and still recorded separately — ASGI hands `query_string=b""` for both `/p` and
`/p?`, so the distinction does not survive to a live HTTP boundary even though the algorithm is now
right.

**No downstream seller repo can prove a fix for #977.** It must be fixed *and* tested inside the SDK,
against `canonicalization.json` directly — the strongest argument for doing this work upstream rather
than waiting for a consumer to demonstrate it, because no consumer can.

---

## 4. Pitfalls, each one measured rather than guessed

- **The vector README's worked example is stale.** It shows the `reject: true` cases expecting
  `request_signature_header_malformed`. The shipped DATA says `request_target_uri_malformed`. **Data
  wins.** Do not "correct" the code from the prose — this is the same class of defect as
  `adcp` #6076/#6078, where a hand-written doc table listed seven codes that do not exist.
- **`positive/004` does not ship `expected_signature_base`**, though the README implies every
  positive does. The set that carries it is **13 files**, not 12 — the README misses `negative/010`.
  Pin the exact set by name; do not compute it from a glob and assume.
- **Do not assert on `failed_step`.** The storyboard calls it informational. The graded artifact is
  the code string.
- **Do not write a second canonicalizer.** If you gate before delegating (as our seam does), keep the
  algorithm single-sourced. The reason this whole family of bugs is dangerous is that a signer and a
  verifier computing `@target-uri` two ways agree only by luck, and disagree silently until a
  production interop failure.
- **A narrow gate beats a broad one.** Anything the gate cannot *prove* malformed should be handed
  through unchanged. Rejecting traffic the spec requires you to accept is worse than the bug being
  closed. In particular leave `Signature-Input` values you cannot parse alone (`negative/011`,
  `negative/024`) — the SDK already returns the right code for those.

---

## 5. Why this matters on a clock

While any of these is open, every downstream implementer either fails the vectors or carries a local
seam. The danger this section originally named — that a seam calcifies into a permanent SECOND
canonicalizer, the exact thing the spec's single-algorithm design exists to prevent — is closed here,
and closed by construction rather than by upstream's clock: this repo VENDORS upstream's own module
verbatim instead of re-deriving the algorithm, so what it runs is your code either way.

Two corrections to the original framing are worth carrying, because they change what "done" means:

- **The seam does not shrink to nothing; only its contents vary.** Callers get the layer's
  canonicalization semantics and can never tell whether a behaviour came from the pinned SDK or the
  vendored copy. When the pin catches up, the vendored directory is deleted and the delegation
  re-pointed, and no caller changes. Promising callers the seam would disappear coupled them to SDK
  release timing — the coupling the layer exists to remove.
- **The one rule that is genuinely ours stays ours** — the comparer-side raw-non-ASCII rejection of
  §2. It is not un-implemented upstream; it is the half of step 2 a signer must not perform.

What is still on the clock is **#976**, plus 7.0.2 becoming adoptable so the vendored directory can go.

**Also still divergent, and not covered by any vector:** spec step 5 says an empty path with an
authority present becomes `/`. 7.0.2 applies it only when a query is present (`https://h.com?x=1` ->
`https://h.com/?x=1`), leaving `https://h.com` alone. No conformance vector covers the no-query case,
so 7.0.2 passes 37/37 while still diverging — the same "a hand-written subset misleads twice" disease
as #975, one layer down. Worth a vector before it is worth a fix.

**Related upstream, for context:** `adcontextprotocol/adcp` #6071 (stale vector counts — the spec
said 28, there are 40), #6076 (seven documented signing error codes that do not exist), #6075 (docs
restate machine-readable spec facts by hand with nothing checking they agree). Same root disease as
#975: a hand-written subset misleads twice, once by being wrong and once by looking exhaustive.
