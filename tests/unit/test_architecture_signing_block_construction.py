"""Guard: the three signing-family wire types are constructed in ONE module (#1291 D1).

The disease this is the AST-detectable form of, in its own words from the code it
replaced (``src/core/tools/capabilities.py``)::

    _WEBHOOK_SIGNING_UNSUPPORTED = WebhookSigning(supported=False)
    _REQUEST_SIGNING_UNSUPPORTED = RequestSigning(supported=False)

Two module-level literals, emitted on both construction sites, declaring
``webhook_signing.supported: false`` for every tenant — including tenants whose
outbound webhooks #1291 C1 had already been RFC 9421-SIGNING for weeks. The wire said
"receivers MUST NOT expect a Signature header" while the socket carried one, and
nothing failed.

A literal is only the cheapest form of the bug. The general form is *any* construction
of ``RequestSigning`` / ``WebhookSigning`` / ``Identity`` outside the module that owns
their derivation: each one is a second source for a field whose whole contract is that
the side ADVERTISING it and the side ENFORCING it read one object.

So: ``src/core/signing/posture.py`` may construct them (it defines the subclasses
``RequestSigningPosture`` / ``WebhookSigningPosture`` / ``IdentityDeclaration``, derives
every field from real backing, and is what both the capabilities builder and the
outbound webhook sender read). Nowhere else in ``src/`` may.

Constructing the SUBCLASSES elsewhere is fine and is the intended path — they carry the
derivation. This guard is about reaching past them to the raw library type.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The guard above confines the LIBRARY types, and deliberately permits constructing
# the derived posture subclasses — that is the sanctioned shape. But the two literals
# D1 deleted (`_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_UNSUPPORTED = WebhookSigning(supported=False)` and its
# request_signing twin) would come back as SUBCLASS constructions and slip it, and the
# parity guard only detects declaration-store reads. So the exact reintroduction of the
# defect D1 fixed was pinned by nothing.
#
# The precise property: a posture fixed at IMPORT time cannot reflect key material or
# trust-root publishability, so it can only ever be a second, stale source. A
# function-local construction from real inputs is fine and is how derivation works.

#: Our derived signing-block types — the ones a module-level constant would freeze.
#: Named as ``src/core/signing/posture.py`` actually spells them: the identity subclass
#: is ``IdentityDeclaration``. (A ``SigningIdentity`` slot here would guard a name that
#: exists nowhere, leaving the third block — the trust-root pointer, whose whole job is
#: to be DERIVED per request from ``src/core/agent_identity.py`` — unguarded.)
