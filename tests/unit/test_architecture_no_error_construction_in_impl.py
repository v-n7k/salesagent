"""Structural guard: ``Error(code=...)`` construction is forbidden in business logic.

Wire-shape decisions live at the transport boundary, not in ``_impl``. Tools and
adapters that need to surface an error to the buyer MUST raise a typed
``AdCPSalesAgentError`` subclass; the boundary builds one ``AdcpErrorResponse``
(``AdcpErrorResponse.of``) and serializes it with ``to_wire``.

This guard counts ``Error(code=...)`` literal construction sites in
``src/core/tools/`` and ``src/adapters/`` per file, with a per-file CAP frozen
at substrate landing. The cap can only SHRINK over time as the cleanup
sweep lands. New code is never added to the cap — the only way to add a new file or
raise a cap is to land a fix that exceeds it intentionally, which is a code-
review red flag.

Capped files may carry a ``# FIXME(#<gh-issue>): migrate to typed
AdCPSalesAgentError raise`` comment at every Error(code=...) site so reviewers can grep
their way to the cleanup work. The comments are aspirational; the cap dict
+ ratchet (`assert_caps_only_shrink`) is the actual enforcement mechanism.
The citation is a GitHub issue, never a local beads id (CLAUDE.md "Rules for
guards"); check_fixme_citation_count.py ratchets that spelling to zero in src/.

Spec: AdCP 3.0.0 (error-handling.mdx) — two-layer envelope is normative.
