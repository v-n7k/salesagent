"""SSRF gate for protocol push / reporting webhook URLs.

Pins that ProtocolWebhookService refuses unsafe URLs before any outbound POST,
mirrors application-level WebhookURLValidator usage in webhook_delivery, and
covers registration wiring for the two surfaces that accept a webhook: the
``push_notification_config`` and ``reporting_webhook`` arguments on
create_media_buy and sync_creatives.

Wire-level VALIDATION_ERROR / recovery=correctable + suggestion for
create_media_buy and sync_creatives is graded by transport-blind BDD scenarios
(BR-UC-002-ext-webhook-ssrf, BR-UC-006-ext-webhook-ssrf).

The A2A-native ``TaskPushNotificationConfig`` endpoints used to translate the
same gate to InvalidParamsError, and three cases here graded that. They are
retired with their subject: this agent advertises ``push_notifications=False``
and declines all four ``tasks/pushNotificationConfig/*`` methods, because AdCP
3.1.1 L3/webhooks.mdx :308 makes the A2A-native channel a separate registration
mechanism with a separate (A2A ``Task``) envelope, and this seller implements
only the AdCP channel. The obligation those cases stood for -- an SSRF URL is
refused before any push config is persisted -- is graded below at the two
surfaces that still accept one.
