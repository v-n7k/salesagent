"""Guard: no strict-xfail transport leg may be deselected, ever.

``pytest_collection_modifyitems`` (tests/bdd/conftest.py) used to keep ONE
mcp/rest "representative" per strict-xfail scenario and deselect the sibling, to
save the runtime of running the same failure path on every transport. That
optimization was deleted on 2026-07-30 (GH #1291 work) for two reasons:

* **it was order-dependent.** The representative was whichever variant appeared
  first in ``items``, and pytest-randomly is active for the bdd env (only
  ``integration`` passes ``-p no:randomly``, tox.ini:82), so the surviving
  transport was a per-run coin flip -- measured as 22 UC-010 nodeids trading
  mcp<->rest between full runs with the per-suite totals conserved, which is why
  pass counts hid it completely;
* **one representative cannot see a transport-specific fix.** Transports diverge
  one at a time here (``_MCP_SELECTIVE_XFAIL`` existed for mcp-only gaps, the
  retired ``_REST_XFAIL_TAGS`` for rest-only ones; running the whole UC-004 file
  with every leg enabled surfaced 13 genuine XPASS(strict), ALL on mcp/rest and
  NONE on a2a). Making the choice deterministic would have converted an
  intermittent blind spot into a permanent one.

So the invariant these tests pin is completeness: for a strict-xfail scenario,
every wire transport leg is collected, each carrying its own strict marker, so an
xpass surfaces on whichever transport production actually fixed.

Drives the REAL pytest_collection_modifyitems via minimal stand-in Items (same
technique as test_bdd_e2e_enabled_xdist_guard.py's stub config), plus one
subprocess collection of a real module so the invariant is graded against real
items, real markers and the real conftest.
