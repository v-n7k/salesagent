"""The harness's request-signature challenge vocabulary is production's own (lane L13, clause 3).

Core Invariant: *the set of codes the harness will let a test name in a
signature challenge is the set the verifier can emit — one derivation, shared
with production, never a second one that answers smaller.*

WHY THIS IS A UNIT TEST AND NOT A SCENARIO, stated rather than assumed. The
subject is :func:`tests.helpers.signing.request_signature_codes`, a HARNESS
vocabulary, and its one consumer is
:meth:`tests.harness.transport.TransportResult.assert_signature_challenge`
in ``tests/harness/transport.py``, which refuses an unknown code UP FRONT
— before it reads the wire at all. So the behaviour is a veto the harness
exercises over a test, and no buyer-visible surface owns it: there is nothing to
drive through ``dispatch_request`` and nothing to read back off a wire. The
outer surface that owns this is the helper itself.

And the lane cannot substitute a wire test for it. ``_verify_signed``
(``src/core/signing/verifier.py``) calls ``_strict_header_precheck`` fourteen
lines above ``reject_malformed_target``, both apply the same
``malformed_authority_reason`` rule, and ``_target_uri``
(``src/core/signing/capture.py``) builds the authority FROM the ``Host`` header
— so every authority the target gate would refuse, the precheck refuses first
with ``request_signature_header_malformed`` at checklist step 1. The verifier's
``_MALFORMED_VALUE_RULES`` table names that pre-emption as deliberate: "Only the
CODE differs by caller — checklist step 1 here, ``request_target_uri_malformed``
there". No wire refusal carrying ``request_target_uri_malformed`` exists to
drive; the only residue is a request with NO Host header and a malformed
``scope["server"]`` (the fallback branch in ``_target_uri``), which no HTTP
client produces and which a test would have to hand-build — a detector, which
this epic's own correction bars.

Covers: salesagent-nx8jp.13 (clause 3 — the challenge vocabulary).
