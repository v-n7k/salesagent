"""Comprehensive import validation tests for all admin blueprints.

These tests validate that all required imports are present in blueprint modules,
preventing NameErrors that would only surface when specific code paths execute.

This approach catches import issues at test time rather than runtime, improving
reliability and catching bugs before they reach production.
