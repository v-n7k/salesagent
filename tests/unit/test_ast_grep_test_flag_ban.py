"""Executable meta-test for the test-flag ast-grep ban.

The ENFORCEMENT is the rule, not this module. It lives at
``.ast-grep/rules/test-flag-never-reaches-production.yml``, is discovered through
``sgconfig.yml``'s ``ruleDirs``, and runs on the ``make quality`` /
``make quality-ci`` ``ast-grep scan`` line. This module stands to it exactly as
``tests/unit/test_ast_grep_credential_header_ban.py`` stands to the credential-header
ban: it proves the ban FIRES, that it is BUILD-FAILING, and that its one exemption is
live rather than prose. It deliberately does not re-implement the detection — a second
AST walk written here would be a divergent copy of the rule, and the rule is the gate.

WHAT THE RULE REFUSES. Any read of ``adcp_testing`` under ``src/``. The flag says a
suite is running and nothing about the seller being served, so a production path that
branches on it serves a different seller under test than in deployment — which makes the
suite's verdict conditional on the suite being what ran it. CLAUDE.md pattern 11 carries
the reasoning and the two fixes, neither of which is the fork.

THE EXEMPTION. ``src/core/config.py``, because it declares the field. Case (d) below is
what keeps that from becoming a hiding place: the file must actually contain reads, and
the properties doing the reading are pinned shrink-only by
``tests/unit/test_test_flag_properties_only_shrink.py``. GH #2255 owns emptying them.
