"""Guard: never fabricate a "<dynamic-value>.example.com" domain as a fallback.

src/core/tools/capabilities.py and src/core/database/models.py
(Tenant.primary_domain) used to fabricate ``f"{subdomain}.example.com"`` whenever
no real domain was configured -- ``example.com`` is RFC 2606 reserved, so the
value is guaranteed unreachable, and callers treat these fields as claims (a
publisher authorization the buyer resolves against, or a guard deciding whether
real domain config exists). This guard bans the exact shape: an f-string literal
whose LAST
segment is a constant string ending in ``.example.com`` and where at least one
value is interpolated before it (the "fabricate a subdomain-based example.com"
form). It intentionally does NOT match a plain literal ``"example.com"`` string
(no interpolation -- a different, separately-tracked pattern) or an f-string where
``.example.com`` is a static substring followed by further interpolation (e.g. a
URL path with a trailing ``{param}`` -- also a different, separately-tracked
pattern), which keeps the guard narrow to the exact disease this ticket fixed.

    # it stopped importing four primitives from the facade and started importing
    # REQUEST_SIGNING plus two CHECK-clause OPERATIONS from the leaf. The SAME THREE
    # violations are listed, at their new coordinates — none added, none fixed.
    #
    # RE-PINNED AGAIN (merge of main into rfc9421-request-signing, +1 line each): the
    # merge added a single `from enum import StrEnum` import to models.py, above all
    # three sites. Verified a pure shift: the source text at 425/435/445 in the merged
    # tree is byte-identical to 424/434/444 in the pre-merge parent, the only hunk above
    # line 424 is that one-line import, and a full AST scan of src/ still finds exactly
    # three violations — all three the same `self.tenant.virtual_host or
    # f"{self.tenant.subdomain}.example.com"` fallback inside Product.effective_properties.
    # Three entries out, three in; none added, none fixed.
    #
    # RE-PINNED A THIRD TIME (merge of main into feat/rfc9421-on-1721, +23 lines each):
    # #1721's rewritten request boundary added lines to models.py ABOVE Product — the last
    # hunk preceding the violations ends at line 232, and the next one starts at 529, so
    # nothing inside Product.effective_properties changed. Verified a pure shift: the source
    # at 448/458/468 is byte-identical to 425/435/445 in the pre-merge parent, the enclosing
    # scope is still Product.effective_properties, and a full AST scan of the MERGED src/
    # finds exactly three violations. Three entries out, three in; none added, none fixed.
    #
    # This allowlist is keyed by LINE NUMBER, so any edit above a violation re-reports it
    # as new AND its old coordinate as stale; re-keying it on (file, symbol) is tracked as
    # a follow-up on #1757. The three re-pins above were all caused by an unrelated edit
    # ABOVE the violations rather than by any change to them.
    #
    # SHRUNK, 3 -> 1, and this one is NOT a re-pin. The three entries were three IDENTICAL
    # copies of the fallback, inline in `Product.effective_properties`'s by_id, by_tag and
    # `all` branches. They are now one `Product.publisher_domain` property, so there is one
    # violation where there were three. The fabrication itself is unfixed and keeps
    # FIXME(#1845); what changed is that fixing it is now a single edit rather than three
    # that could diverge. (The same commit strips a port from the value for a separate
    # reason -- see the property's docstring -- which does not touch this shape.)
