"""CI guard: the L2 execution plan covers every vendored vector, mechanically.

#1291 B3 (``salesagent-z6nr.14``), design step 6. ``TRANSPLANT`` is OUR data about
how each conformance vector is driven against the real app. Two ways it can rot
silently, both of which produce a vacuous pass rather than a failure:

* a new upstream vector arrives and is never planned (so it never runs), or a stale
  row lingers for a vector that no longer exists;
* a hand-typed ``wire_url`` diverges from the mechanical transplant rule, so the
  request sent is not the request the row claims — and a canonicalization pathology
  (``:443``, ``/./``, ``%2F``, ``[2001:db8::1]``) is quietly normalised away.

Both are guarded here, in ``tests/unit`` (pure data, no app, no DB), so they fail at
``make quality`` rather than inside a 40-case integration run.
