"""Guard: the UC-010 dormancy xfail cites a tracking issue PER TAG, never one shared string.

A single hardcoded reason string served all 33 dormant ``T-UC-010-*`` tags and cited #1855
for every one of them. That is right for the media_buy presence-object cluster and wrong for
the signing, identity and unbacked-capability clusters — and because it was a hardcoded
fallback rather than a per-tag reason, neither stale-citation guard could see it: they read
``.feature`` comments and ``_XFAIL_TAGS``, not this branch (#1721 review F2).

A citation that is plausible but wrong is worse than none: it reads as tracked work, so
nobody re-checks it.

Where the obligation lives NOW
------------------------------
#1858 deleted ``_harness_env``'s ``elif`` chain and ``_detect_uc``. Routing is declarative:
``EnvRoute`` rows in ``ENV_ROUTES``, resolved by ``storyboard_spec.resolve_env_route`` over
the marker set from ``derive_marker_names``. The UC-010 dormancy branch became
``_uc010_dormancy_rows()`` — ONE row generated per ``_UC010_DORMANT_TRACKING`` entry, each
carrying that tag's own ``xfail_reason``, plus a citation-free ``uc010-not-wired`` catch-all
for a dormant tag with no established tracking home.

The property is unchanged, so the guard is unchanged in force; only its LOCATOR moved. The
previous locator pinned the deleted shape (an inline ``pytest.xfail(...)`` inside an
``if not (marker_names ...)`` branch) and, worse, degraded silently: its source-slicing
helper returned ``""`` when the anchor vanished, so the consult-check was asserting against
an empty string rather than against production.

What this guard pins, and why each check earns its place:

* Its own subjects still resolve (:func:`assert_guard_subject_resolves`). A guard that
  reaches production by string keeps passing after a rename — it finds nothing, which is
  indistinguishable from finding nothing wrong. That is exactly how this file broke.
* The reason a dormant tag ACTUALLY xfails with — obtained by running the real resolver over
  the real registry, not by reading source — must cite exactly that tag's own issue. One
  shared literal cannot satisfy this for tags with different tracking homes, so reverting to
  a shared string cannot stay green whether or not the map survives beside it.
* No string literal in a UC-010 dormancy reason may hardcode an issue number. This is the
  structural complement: once the map shrinks to a single distinct issue, the behavioral
  check alone could no longer tell a hardcoded literal from a map lookup.
* Every mapped tag must actually be dormant, so the map shrinks as scenarios get wired
  instead of accumulating stale entries.
