"""Unit tests for pure helper functions in src/core/tools/accounts.py.

Covers:
- _check_billing_policy (BR-RULE-059): validates billing against seller's supported_billing
- _build_setup_for_approval (BR-RULE-060): builds Setup for pending_approval modes

These are pure functions with no DB or transport dependencies, so they are
tested in isolation without the harness.
