"""GOVERNANCE_REVOCATIONS_PATH must match what the SDK's consumer derives.

#1291 A5 follow-up, salesagent-z6nr.27. The SDK exposes no path CONSTANT for
this (unlike ``src.core.agent_identity.AGENT_ENDPOINT_PATHS``, which the
integration test discovers from the running app) — only an f-string inside
``CachingRevocationChecker.from_issuer_origin``. This pins our path constant
against that private derivation via its ``_revocation_uri`` attribute, so a
divergence is a wired test failure, not a counterparty finding our list 404s.
