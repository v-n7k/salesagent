"""Regression: which transports grade a BDD scenario must not depend on the run.

salesagent-1iidr. Measured across two full runs of the SAME tree
(test-results/innet_080926_0943 and innet_080926_1145, bdd_inprocess.json,
568 UC-010 nodeids each): a2a was collected 200 times in both, but mcp/rest
split 182/175 and then 179/178, and six scenarios changed which pair they ran
on -- ``test_brandblock__brand_protocol_capabilities_experimental_in_v31``
went [a2a, mcp] -> [a2a, rest], ``test_capabilities_response_includes_all_``
``targeting_dimensions`` went the other way. Reproduced here at seed level:
seeds 1/2/3 over the UC-010 module gave mcp/rest 183/166, 171/178, 174/175.

The cause was ``pytest_collection_modifyitems``'s strict-xfail representative
keeping the FIRST mcp/rest sibling it walked, over an ``items`` order that
pytest-randomly reshuffles every run (the ``bdd_inprocess`` tox env does not
pass ``-p no:randomly``). The transport it skipped was ungraded -- and
invisibly so: it presents as ~19 removed / ~19 added nodeids, exactly the
benign transport-parameter noise ``scripts/audit/compare_runs.py`` documents,
so every nodeid-set comparison reported CLEAN.

Why this test collects for real instead of asserting on the constant: the
counts are not the contract, stability is. Any future collection-time
condition that reads run-varying state -- a clock, a set iteration order, a
worker id -- reintroduces the same defect without touching the code this
one lived in, and this test still fails.
