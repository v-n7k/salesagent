"""Structural guard: Given-step helper methods in tests/harness/ must be
``@realize_e2e``-wrapped (directly or by delegation) or explicitly allowlisted
(salesagent-689e sweep-verify).

Disease pattern this guards against: a harness env "Given-step" helper method
(``set_*``/``make_*``/``break_*``/``configure_*``) implemented as a plain
in-process ``unittest.mock`` setter with NO ``@realize_e2e`` dual-branch
dispatch — the established pattern in ``tests/harness/`` (``_realize.py``,
exemplified by ``DeliveryPollMixin`` and ``CreativeFormatsEnv``). Such a
method silently no-ops over e2e_rest instead of realizing the intent or
declaring it unrealizable, so a scenario that thinks it configured a fault
actually asserts against unconfigured server state.

Escape hatches, each requiring a pinned, reasoned entry (ratchet like
``EXPECTED_LEDGER`` / ``EXPECTED_UNSUPPORTED_DECLARATIONS`` — adding OR
removing an entry requires updating this file in the same change and saying
why):

  * ``ALLOWLIST_DELEGATES_TO_REALIZE_E2E`` -- the public method builds data
    and hands off to a private ``@realize_e2e``-decorated sibling (the
    "build-then-realize" variant of the pattern, e.g.
    ``DeliveryPollMixin.set_adapter_response`` -> ``_realize_adapter_response``).
  * ``ALLOWLIST_ALWAYS_DB_WRITE`` -- the method writes through the real DB
    session unconditionally (``self._session``), so the same code path is
    already correct in both in-process and e2e mode; no branch needed.
  * ``ALLOWLIST_NOT_WIRE_DISPATCHED`` -- the env's call path never crosses
    the wire (TRANSPORT-BYPASS, documented at tests/bdd/conftest.py
    ``_production_db_pointed_at``) so an in-process mock is correct in every
    parametrized "transport" row.
  * ``ALLOWLIST_NOT_BDD_REACHABLE`` -- no BDD Given step calls this method at
    all (verified by grep against tests/bdd/steps/), so it's never dispatched
    over e2e and the pattern doesn't apply. Latent risk if a future Given
    step starts calling it — re-run the scan then.
  * ``ALLOWLIST_UNIT_ONLY_ENV`` -- the owning class is ``BaseTestEnv``-rooted
    (not ``IntegrationEnv``), so it never runs over e2e by construction.
  * ``ALLOWLIST_PURE_BUILDER`` -- the method BUILDS and returns a value and
    mutates nothing: no mock, no DB row, no server state. The disease is a
    setter that silently no-ops over e2e, and a method that sets nothing has
    nothing to no-op; ``@realize_e2e`` would have no second branch to dispatch
    to. The name regex matches these on the ``make_`` verb alone, so they are
    named here rather than narrowed out of the regex -- a hand-written row can
    be audited, whereas a regex carve-out is a silent hole for every future
    method that happens to fit it.

Methods decorated with ``@realize_e2e(e2e_unsupported(...))`` are the honest
declaration itself and are excluded from this guard entirely (not an escape
hatch — see ``_is_realize_e2e_decorated``).
