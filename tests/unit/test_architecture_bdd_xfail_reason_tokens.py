"""Guard: the BDD deselection exemption must read a TOKEN, not free English.

``tests/bdd/conftest.py``'s ``pytest_collection_modifyitems`` deselects the
redundant mcp/rest copies of a strict-xfail scenario, and exempts scenarios whose
xfail reason declares ``scope=per-transport`` — an obligation each transport
enforces separately has to xpass on its own, so deselecting two of three would
grade a cross-transport MUST on one transport and call it covered.

Today the exemption is ``"scope=per-transport" in str(reason)``: an unguarded
substring test against a free-text field. Two measured consequences, both of them
silent:

  * Retyping the token to ``scope=per_transport`` drops eight rows from collection
    (the mcp and rest copies of UC-003's four CONFLICT Examples rows) and NOTHING
    fails: deselected items simply cease to exist. Measured on the UC-003 module:
    132 passed, 70 deselected, 1208 xfailed, 0 failed.
  * The substring is not even reading the token. The #1607 reason ALSO explains
    itself in prose — "scope=per-transport because each transport enforces (or
    fails to enforce) independently" — so retyping the actual token while leaving
    the sentence alone drops ZERO rows. The predicate was matching an English
    sentence and would have gone on matching it with the declaration deleted.

So the reason field needs a parse: a ``cause=``-prefixed reason is a typed record,
and a value outside the vocabulary is an ERROR rather than a silent miss.

Deliberately NARROW, and the claim is DETECTED, not "unrepresentable":

  * Only a reason that STARTS with ``cause=`` is parsed. 62 of the 65 xfail sites
    under ``tests/bdd/`` are free text and three of those already contain ``k=``
    pairs of their own (``code='NOT_FOUND'``, ``action='failed'``,
    ``principal_id=null``), so keys cannot be validated globally — the typed form
    has to be recognised before it can be checked. The 62 pass through untouched;
    this guard does not sweep them.
  * A typo in the ``cause=`` recogniser itself still degrades silently, into a
    free-text reason. That residue is stated rather than papered over.
