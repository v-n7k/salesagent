"""Guard: UC-010 xfail reason TEXT must describe the actual measured failure, and the
mi0x v3.1.1 scenario cluster must not claim "graded" while dormant.

``tests/unit/test_architecture_bdd_no_stale_xfail_citations.py`` only checks TAG
MEMBERSHIP (is a scenario's tag still registered in one of the xfail structures) — it
does not validate that a *registered* tag's reason STRING actually names the failure
production currently produces, nor that a UC-010 tag claiming a graded "#1592
production gap" in its Gherkin comment has ever actually run against production
(``_uc010_wired_tags()``/``_UC010_WIRED_TAGS`` gate). This guard closes that gap:

    An xfail reason must describe the ACTUAL first failing assert measured on that
    transport, cite the specific GH issue that will make the scenario true (never a
    stale/umbrella one), and must be re-derived the moment the reason it was written
    stops being accurate. A scenario that never runs must not claim a graded result.

1. ``T-UC-010-main``'s ``_XFAIL_TAGS`` reason must not repeat the stale
   "supported_pricing_models, reporting_delivery_methods not emitted" claim: both
   derive correctly now, and the Then order in
   ``BR-UC-010-discover-seller-capabilities.feature`` fails on ``account.sandbox``
   before ever reaching those fields.

2. ``T-UC-010-targeting``'s reason must not claim "geo_postal_areas uses the deprecated
   boolean-alias shape" — ``_build_geo_postal_areas`` builds the native country-keyed
   map correctly.

3. The 4 mi0x-cluster v3.1.1 scenarios (``creative_multiplicity``,
   ``creative_agentic_flags``, ``governance_aware``, ``vendor_metric_optimization``) have
   no Given/When/Then step definitions yet, so they are correctly absent from
   ``_UC010_WIRED_TAGS`` and fast-xfail via the generic dormant fallback. Their Gherkin
   comments must say so honestly (DORMANT), not claim a graded "#1592 production gap"
   they never actually run against.

Where the obligation lives NOW
------------------------------
The property is unchanged; only the LOCATORS moved, and both moved the same way —
from source shape to live value:

* ``_xfail_tags_reasons()`` required ``_XFAIL_TAGS`` to be a module-level
  ``ast.Dict`` of constant-to-constant pairs. It now reads the dict object
  ``conftest.py:1651`` actually iterates, so a reason built any other way is graded
  rather than skipped.
* The wired-tag gate was scanned as a bare ``_UC010_WIRED_TAGS`` set literal. #1858
  moved it inside ``_uc010_wired_tags()`` as ``frozenset({...})`` — an ``ast.Call``
  — and every check here died on that assert. It is now obtained by CALLING the
  accessor.
* The mi0x Gherkin check sliced 2000 characters after ``text.index(f"@{tag}")``.
  A window is not a scenario: too short and it misses a comment at the foot of the
  block, too long and it reports the NEXT scenario's comment against this tag. It
  now uses the same Gherkin block parser the citation guard uses.

Absence is the failure mode all three shared: a drained locator reports "no
violations", which is what compliance looks like. :class:`TestGuardIsNotVacuous`
pins the subjects so the next such move fails loudly here instead.
