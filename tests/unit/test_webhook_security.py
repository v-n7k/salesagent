class TestWebhookURLValidator:
    """Test SSRF protection in webhook URL validation.

    WebhookURLValidator is the REGISTRATION-time gate: validate_webhook_url_registration
    performs no DNS resolution, while the outbound/SEND-time gate lives on the egress seam
    (see the outbound-fetch tests). Both roles are graded here and there respectively.

    The ADDRESS cases below use ``https://`` so the address verdict is what they
    grade: the scheme is checked first (egress.policy._scheme_error), so a plain-http
    fixture here would be refused for its scheme under the default posture and the
    ``10.0.0.0/8``-style assertions would stop grading the address policy at all.
    The scheme decision itself is graded on its own, in
    ``TestWebhookSchemeGateTracksTheEgressSeam``.

    POSTURE IS PINNED, and that is load-bearing. ``tests/conftest.py`` sets
    ``ADCP_TESTING=true`` autouse for the whole suite, and under it the gate
    hands any loopback verdict to ``_maybe_allow_localhost``, which RESCUES it.
    An address case left on the ambient posture would therefore grade the
    testing-mode allowance instead of the address policy it claims to grade —
    and the two loopback cases would flip from refused to accepted outright
    (verified: removing the fixture below fails exactly those two).
    The allowance is real behaviour and is graded on purpose, in
    ``TestLocalhostAllowanceUnderTestingMode`` below; here it is switched off so
    these cases mean what their names say.

    ``validate_webhook_url_registration`` hands its verdict to

    ``ADCP_TESTING`` is set. That branch is what lets an e2e capture server on
    127.0.0.1 register at all — live production behaviour, and until now asserted
    NOWHERE: the only cases that touched it graded the NEGATIVE (that the
    allowance must not also rescue a bad SCHEME), and the two tests that reached
    it directly went through ``validate_for_testing``, which this change deletes.

    Both branches are pinned explicitly because the suite sets ``ADCP_TESTING=true``
    autouse: a one-branch test here would silently grade whichever posture the
    fixture happened to leave behind, which is exactly how a gate control goes
    inert without anyone noticing.

    ``LOOPBACK_URLS`` are https (salesagent-e6h0): the scheme hatch this class
    used to open no longer exists — ``_maybe_allow_localhost`` checks the
    SCHEME first and refuses to rescue a scheme failure, so an e2e capture
    server on loopback must register a REAL https URL now (matching
    ``tests/e2e/_webhook_capture_loopback.py``'s loopback-covered TLS front —
    the hermetic (no-Docker-stack) capture path, salesagent-amht.3). This
