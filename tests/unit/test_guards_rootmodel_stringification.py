"""Guard: a VERIFIED RootModel field is never stringified.

Disease: interpolating a pydantic ``RootModel`` into a string does NOT yield the
wrapped scalar — ``RootModel`` does not override ``__str__``, so an f-string,
``str()``, ``+`` concat, ``%``-format or ``join()`` renders the model's repr,
``root='94103'``. Wherever that string then goes — a wire message, a persisted
natural key, a log line — it is wrong, and for a ``JSONType`` column it can make the
row unloadable through the ORM. This is a repeat offender across the codebase
(``BrandReference.brand_id``, then ``CreateMediaBuyRequest.start_time``), which is why
it gets a guard rather than another one-off fix.

**What is banned:** stringification of the curated set of fields whose declared type
was verified to be (or to contain) a RootModel. Not the raw output of
``scripts/ci/scan_rootmodel_stringification.py`` — that scan is name-anchored over
every RootModel-typed field name in the SDK, and most of its hits are name collisions
on unrelated models (``BrandReference.domain`` is ``str``, our ``FormatId.id`` is
``str``, ``.value`` is an ``Enum``, ``.text`` is a ``requests.Response``). Baselining
those would bake noise into the guard. The curated set is what a reader can trust.

**Why there is no diagnostic/value exemption:** the scan splits hits into "diagnostic"
(log/exception text) and "value" (persisted/returned). That split is unsound as a
soundness signal — an inlined ``raise ValueError(f"...{x}")`` classifies as diagnostic
while the identical defect written as ``msg = f"...{x}"`` then ``raise ValueError(msg)``
classifies as value. An earlier sweep missed a real buyer-facing defect for exactly
that reason. For a field verified to be a RootModel there is no context in which
``root='US'`` is the intended rendering, so the form is banned outright.

**Why ``start_time`` is resolved by ANNOTATION, not by name or receiver name:**
``start_time`` is ``StartTiming`` (a RootModel) on ``CreateMediaBuyRequest`` but a
plain ``datetime`` on ``UpdateMediaBuyRequest`` and on the ORM ``MediaBuy``. A bare
name rule would demand ``.root`` on a datetime (an ``AttributeError``); a
receiver-NAME rule (``req``/``request`` only) fails in both directions — it would flag
the ``req.start_time`` reads in ``media_buy_update.py``, where ``req`` is an
``UpdateMediaBuyRequest``, and it would MISS ``self.start_time`` inside
``CreateMediaBuyRequest`` itself (``src/core/schemas/_base.py``), which is the one
place the defect has no ``req`` to anchor on. Resolving the receiver to the enclosing
function's annotated parameter type — and, for ``self``, to the enclosing class name —
is pure AST, exact, and needs no exemptions.

**Fields deliberately OUT of the set:**

- ``brand_id`` — already banned more strongly by
  ``tests/unit/test_guards_brand_id_single_accessor.py``, which forbids reading the
  ATTRIBUTE at all outside ``src/core/helpers/brand_key.py``. Duplicating it here
  would be duplicated logic.
- ``geo_metros`` — ``GeoMetro`` is NOT a RootModel (it has ``system``/``values``
  fields), so its rendering is not this defect. ``src/adapters/mock_ad_server.py``
  stringifies it on the line adjacent to two banned sites; that is intentional, not an
  oversight.

**Known blind spot (pinned below, not papered over):** element-level stringification
bound to a local first — ``rendered = [f"{c}" for c in overlay.geo_countries]`` — is
NOT caught. The comprehension element is the loop variable, and no attribute in the
banned set is stringified at that node. ``TestGuardMetaCases`` pins this as a
would-be-missed case so the limit is visible rather than assumed away.

**Do not "fix" a violation with a defensive ``hasattr`` probe for the root
attribute** — ``tests/unit/test_architecture_no_defensive_rootmodel.py`` bans that
form outright (the literal is omitted here so this docstring does not trip it).
RootModel presence is trusted: read ``.root`` directly.
