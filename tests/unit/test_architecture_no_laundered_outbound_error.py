"""Guard: a creative-agent registry dial must not let ``OutboundError`` fall into a bare catch-all.

KEPT DELIBERATELY, with the measurement that decided it. A proposal retired this
guard, or narrowed it to one function, on the grounds that its subject "became a
type error". It did not: handler ORDERING is not expressible in the type system
at all — mypy accepts a generic ``except`` placed ahead of the specific one —
and the four subject sites in ``src/core/tools/creatives/_processing.py`` are
live. Neither deleting nor narrowing this guard is safe.

``CreativeAgentRegistry.preview_creative``/``build_creative`` dial the egress
seam (``call_mcp_tool`` -> ``validate_url``), which raises
``OutboundRequestBlocked``/``OutboundDeliveryFailed`` (``src/core/security/
outbound_http.py``) — already correctly classified by the seam. A ``try``
around one of these calls whose only broad handler is ``except Exception``
(with no ``except OutboundError`` ahead of it) launders that classification
into a generic message with the WRONG recovery hint (salesagent-ukln: a
terminal refusal reported as ``recovery="transient"``, "Retry recommended").

The fix (salesagent-ukln) added ``except OutboundError: raise_mapped_outbound_error(...)``
ahead of the generic branch in both ``_create_new_creative`` and
``_update_existing_creative`` (``src/core/tools/creatives/_processing.py``).
This guard pins that shape going forward — codebase-scan (salesagent-w517.4)
found exactly these 2 dial methods swallowed by exactly this branch ordering; the
scan set is a fixed, named pair of registry methods, not a broad heuristic.
