"""The scheme predicate — the one decision that makes a trust root reachable.

salesagent-tgzb design step 8. ``_get_protocol_for_domain`` is the SINGLE place
that decides whether this agent publishes ``http://`` or ``https://`` for a host:
``canonical_agent_url`` (``src/core/agent_identity.py``) is its only caller
outside ``src/core/domain_config.py``, where ``get_a2a_server_url`` also derives
its scheme from it. Until this module existed it had **zero direct coverage**, so
the constraint salesagent-tgzb turns on — *the production predicate must not be
weakened to make the test stack serve https* — was enforced by nothing.

This module guards EXISTING behaviour; it drives no new production code. It is a
unit module on purpose: the https branch is invisible from any outer surface for
hosts like ``seller.example.com`` or ``x.adcp.test``, because no stack in this
repo answers there. The predicate is a pure function of one string, with no I/O.
