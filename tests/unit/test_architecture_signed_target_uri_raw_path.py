"""Guard: the signed ``@target-uri`` is built from the RAW wire bytes, and the
strict header gate reads the RAW header list.

Two halves of one disease — reading a NORMALIZED view of the request where the
signature-covered bytes are required. Both were live defects; this guard is what
stops either coming back.

Where the two subjects live now
------------------------------
#1721 split the single ``request_verifier_middleware.py`` that used to hold both
halves. The obligations are unchanged; the code that carries them moved:

* ``@target-uri`` is built in :mod:`src.core.signing.capture` — the ASGI capture
  that records the HTTP message on ``scope["state"]`` while its bytes still
  exist. ``_signed_path`` reads the raw bytes, ``_target_uri`` assembles the URL,
  ``SignedExchangeCapture.__call__`` stores it on the ``HttpExchange``.
* the strict header gate is :func:`src.core.signing.verifier._strict_header_precheck`,
  which now runs inside the boundary's resolver rather than in a middleware, so
  it is HANDED ``HttpExchange.raw_headers`` instead of reading the scope itself.
  That is why half 2 is graded across the two hops that carry it.

**Half 1 — the path.** ``scope["path"]`` is percent-DECODED by every real ASGI
server (uvicorn sets ``path = unquote(raw_path)``). The signature covers the
bytes the client sent, so a decoded path yields a signature base the client never
signed and rejects a legitimate request. ``_signed_path`` therefore reads
``scope["raw_path"]``. Conformance vectors ``positive/008`` (percent-encoded
non-ASCII), ``009`` (percent-encoded unreserved) and ``010`` (``%2F`` preserved)
are what prove it.

**Half 2 — the headers.** ``_strict_header_precheck`` runs over the raw
``list[tuple[bytes, bytes]]`` the capture recorded from ``scope["headers"]``, and
NOT over a collapsed dict view. ``headers_from_asgi_scope`` — like every dict
view of ASGI headers — LAST-WINS on a repeated header line rather than joining
it, so a proxy-inserted second ``Content-Type`` / ``Content-Digest`` /
``Signature-Input`` line rewrites a covered value before any check over the dict
could run. That second-line form is the attack ``negative/021``, ``022``, ``023``
and ``026`` actually describe; the vectors merely happen to EXPRESS it as one
comma-joined value, so a gate written over the collapsed dict passes all four
vectors while missing the threat.

**Why a blanket "always use raw_path" rule would be a REGRESSION — and why the
allowlist below is not a weakening.** Some sites read the DECODED path ON
PURPOSE, because they are routing predicates that MUST agree with the Starlette
router, which itself routes on the decoded path: ``src/core/http_utils.py``'s
``path_from_asgi_scope`` (the published route-table path rule), ``src/app.py``'s
REST error label and its ``/a2a`` predicate, and the capture's own surface test.
Making those read raw bytes would pull a different set of requests under the
capture than the dispatcher actually routes — the mirror defect, and a worse one.
So:

* the scan is SCOPED to ``src/core/signing/`` (where ``@target-uri`` is built),
  not to the whole tree;
* inside that scope, the surface predicate in ``SignedExchangeCapture.__call__``
  is ALLOWLISTED BY NAME with its reason: it feeds ``is_adcp_surface``, which
  decides whether to capture at all, and it must select the same requests the
  router dispatches to ``/mcp``, ``/a2a`` and ``/api/v1``. It reads
  ``path_from_asgi_scope`` — the published route-table rule — and not
  ``scope["path"]``, because those two are not the same path: ``scope["path"]``
  still carries ``root_path``, the router strips it, and under any prefix mount
  the predicate stopped selecting requests the router was still dispatching. The
  capture then recorded nothing and the verifier read every signed request as
  unsigned, silently. The row names the helper form for that reason;
* the documented fallback inside ``_signed_path`` (``raw_path`` absent or
  non-ASCII -> the decoded path, degradation stated at the source) is
  allowlisted, and ``test_signed_path_reads_raw_path`` separately pins that the
  fallback cannot become the only source;
* ``TestDeliberatelyDecodedSitesStayDecoded`` pins the out-of-scope routing
  sites as still DECODED, so a future blanket "fix" fails here instead of
  silently desynchronising us from the router.

Everything here is AST-based — there is no regex component, so there is no
near-miss/"would-be-missed" regex variant to pin.
