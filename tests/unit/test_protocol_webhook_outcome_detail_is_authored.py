"""The protocol sender's unexpected-error branch authors its own outcome detail.

Covers salesagent-pldmk.6, Move 2 -- the SECOND of the two out-of-module
``WebhookDeliveryOutcome`` construction sites.

``WebhookDeliveryOutcome.detail``'s own docstring says it is "PRE-SANITIZED at
construction: never a URL, never a credential". Two sites outside the owning
module (``src/core/security/webhook_egress.py``) construct the outcome directly
and pass ``detail=str(e)`` for an arbitrary caught exception:

1. ``src/services/webhook_delivery_service.py:606`` -- graded by
   ``tests/unit/test_delivery_service_behavioral.py::TestDeliverWithBackoffGenericException``,
   which was updated in this same change to stop pinning ``detail=str(e)``.
   Not re-graded here: the setup is the queue/poller shape that lives in that
   module, and copying it would duplicate a block for no extra coverage.
2. ``src/services/protocol_webhook_service.py:360`` -- THIS module. It had zero
   coverage of any kind before this file existed.

Why ``outcome.detail`` at the branch is the right choke point rather than a
downstream proxy: both durable surfaces read that one field VERBATIM.
``src/core/database/repositories/delivery.py:327`` writes it to
``webhook_delivery_log.error_message``, and ``protocol_webhook_service.py:280``
emits it as an audit warning. So this is disclosure into storage and into an
operator record, not just into a log line.

The stimulus is the case the branch's OWN comment names -- "the pinned transport's
own wrong-host guard raises a bare RuntimeError". That message is, verbatim from
``adcp/signing/ip_pinned_transport.py:150-154``, an interpolation of TWO
hostnames into a field contracted never to carry a URL.
