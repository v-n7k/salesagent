"""Guard: the harness has ONE dispatch mechanism, and it lives on the base.

The invariant: ``AdCPTestClient`` is the
implementation ``call_via``/``call_mcp``/``call_a2a`` delegate to, **not** a
peer beside them. Today the harness carries two live dispatch mechanisms — the
generic ``AdCPTestClient`` (``tests/harness/client.py``) and the hand-written
``call_mcp``/``call_a2a`` quartet re-implemented on every env class — and the
old quartet is still the default authoring path, so each new env adds a 35th,
36th... copy.

This guard pins the finished shape:

1. ``call_mcp`` / ``call_a2a`` are defined ONCE, on ``BaseTestEnv``
   (``tests/harness/_base.py``), as ``deliver_*(...).payload``, and are NEVER
   overridden by a subclass. A new env written on the old pattern fails CI.
2. Transport overrides that genuinely need to stay are ``deliver_mcp`` /
   ``deliver_a2a`` returning a ``DeliverResult`` — counted against a
   shrink-only allowlist. Per the reviewed change-set's binding input R2, the
   census MUST count ``def deliver_mcp``/``def deliver_a2a``: a
   ``call_mcp``/``call_a2a`` census reads ZERO after the rename and would
   grade nothing, passing vacuously.
3. ``_last_wire_response`` — the per-env private wire-stash attribute the
   dispatchers reach across object boundaries to read — does not exist. The
   wire travels on the RETURN VALUE (``DeliverResult.wire_response``).
   Deleting the attribute is what makes a second writer structurally
   impossible (change-set B2 + binding input R3).

MEMBERSHIP IS AST-DERIVED, NOT A DIRECTORY GLOB (change-set §5, finding 4).
A ``tests/harness/*.py`` glob is evadable and the evasion path is ALREADY
occupied by env subclasses defined outside it — a dozen of them live under
``tests/integration/`` (the pinned exemplar is ``_RefusalDialectEnv`` in
``tests/integration/test_harness_rest_refusal.py``, which reaches an env root
only TRANSITIVELY, via the harness class ``MediaBuyCreateListEnv``) — plus one
nested inside a test function in ``tests/harness/test_harness_base.py``. This
guard resolves class ancestry by name, transitively, across the whole ``tests/``
tree, so an env is caught wherever it is written. It is also why the scan is
AST and not text: a ``def call_mcp`` inside a STRING literal, which a grep census
would miscount as a real definition, is not a definition.
