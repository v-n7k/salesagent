"""L1(a) — signature-base conformance, over the vectors' ORIGINAL untouched URLs.

#1291 B3 (``salesagent-z6nr.14``), design step 3. Grading level L1 of three:

* **L1 (here)** — no app, no DB, no crypto, no transplant, no re-signing. For every
  vector shipping ``expected_signature_base``, compute the signature base from the
  vector's OWN url/method/headers and assert it equals the shipped bytes EXACTLY.
* **L2** (``tests/integration/test_signing_conformance_vectors.py``) — the 15-check
  ordering, the wire envelope and the error codes, through the real middleware.
* **L3** — B4 (``salesagent-z6nr.15``), black-box, the vectors' own URL space.

Why this level cannot go green vacuously — and why it must exist. At L2 the harness
re-signs 14 transplanted vectors using the SAME canonicalizer the verifier uses, so
signer and verifier agree BY CONSTRUCTION whatever they compute; positives 005-012
(default-port, dot-segment, query bytes, percent-encoding, IPv6) would pass
tautologically if L2 were the only grading. Here NOTHING of ours produced the
expected bytes: ``expected_signature_base`` is spec-authored data, and the vector
README says it "exists specifically to make this check byte-level and
implementation-independent", warning that "locking a canonicalization bug into the
committed signatures would be the worst outcome". This is the level that grades
canonicalization honestly.

Deliberately NOT asserted: that re-signing the base reproduces the vector's shipped
``Signature`` bytes. The README calls that a convenience check, explicitly not
normative, and ES256 is non-deterministic under random-k.

Which canonicalizer this grades, and which it does not. ``build_signature_base`` is
imported from the SDK, not from :mod:`src.core.signing.canonical`, and that is
correct rather than an oversight: request signing is the SDK's per CLAUDE.md pattern
#9, ``adcp.signing.verifier.verify_request_signature`` resolves ``@target-uri``
through this exact function, and :mod:`src.vendor.adcp_canonical` deliberately
re-exports only the canonicalization entry points so the signing half cannot be
reached through the seam. So this module grades the bytes the verifier will really
compute. The vendored copy's own grading is
``tests/unit/test_url_canonicalization_vectors.py``, against the 37 format-id
vectors — a different vector set exercising the shapes (IDN hosts, the DNS root dot,
a trailing empty query, six authority forms) that the 13 rows below never reach.
Two graded artifacts, one per canonicalizer; neither stands in for the other.

Spec grounding: AdCP 3.1.1 (``adcp==6.6.0``);
``adcontextprotocol/adcp@v3.1.1:docs/reference/url-canonicalization.mdx``
(the authoritative canonicalization algorithm — security.mdx §"@target-uri
canonicalization" defers to it) and ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/test-vectors/
request-signing/{positive,negative}/``.
