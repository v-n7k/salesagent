"""The registration carrier does not render the buyer's credential.

Covers #1617, Move 1.

``ValidatedWebhookRegistration`` is a frozen slotted dataclass holding the
pinned ``PushNotificationConfig``. With the dataclass-generated ``__repr__``
live, ``repr()`` walks into ``config.authentication.credentials`` and prints
the buyer's shared secret in full. That is not theoretical: the value's TYPE
changed under an unchanged INFO log line at
``src/admin/blueprints/creatives.py:140`` (it used to be the ORM row, whose
hand-written ``__repr__`` masks with ``'***'``), so the secret reaches an
operator log at INFO today.

The fix is ``@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True, repr=False)`` plus an
explicit ``__repr__`` that names ``webhook_url_for_log(url)`` and the
authentication TYPE -- diagnosable, and with the secret unreachable through
it. ``field(repr=False)`` on ``config`` alone is NOT the fix: the type has
exactly one field, so that yields ``ValidatedWebhookRegistration()``, an empty
repr nothing can be diagnosed from. Hence the positive assertions below.

SCOPE, deliberately partial. This module grades the OUTER carrier only.
``repr(r.config)`` -- the inner pydantic model -- still discloses the
credential, and that is a RATIFIED residual, not an oversight: PR #1802's review
(§ Residual risk (4)) defers it to
a ``SecretStr`` escalation, blocked on three facts (``credentials: str`` lives
on a GENERATED SDK model, a nested re-annotation is CLAUDE.md Pattern #4
territory, and ``SecretStr.model_dump()`` would write ``**********`` into a
persistence path that is read back for signing). Do NOT add an assertion here
that ``repr(r.config)`` is clean -- it will not be, by plan.
