"""Vendored AdCP fixtures keep upstream's own ``$id``, and the refresh script
refuses to write anything else.

``tests/fixtures/adcp_schemas_pinned/`` vendors frozen upstream artifacts from
TWO upstream revisions, which namespace their schemas DIFFERENTLY — so there
are two legitimate ``$id`` conventions in the directory, not one:

- the **flat** tree — artifacts fetched from ``static/schemas/source`` at
  ``PINNED_SHA``, where upstream's own ``$id`` is version-free:
  ``/schemas/<category>/<name>.json``. The pin there is a SHA, not a spec
  version, so a version segment in one of THOSE files would be an assertion of
  a spec identity the commit does not carry (``_refresh.py``, "$id convention").
  ``enums/error-code.json`` is the one reviewed exception — it was re-vendored
  from the ``v3.1.1`` TAG (#1721 M5), so upstream's verbatim ``$id`` there DOES
  carry the version while the file keeps its stable flat path. The exception is
  recorded as data below rather than woven into the rule.
- the **versioned** tree, ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>/`` — the trust-root
  documents fetched from ``dist/schemas`` at git tag ``v3.1.1`` (#1291 A3),
  where upstream's own ``$id`` DOES carry the version:
  ``/schemas/3.1.1/<path>.json``. Those documents are consumed by
  ``tests/integration/test_trust_root_documents.py`` through
  ``tests/helpers/pinned_schema.py``'s version-prefixed refs; 29 of them differ
  STRUCTURALLY from the installed SDK's generated copies, which is why they are
  vendored at all.

Both conventions are graded here — each file against the one ITS OWN upstream
revision writes — because the rule ``_refresh.py`` actually enforces is
"upstream's ``$id``, verbatim", and the layout rule stores each file at that
``$id`` minus the ``/schemas/`` prefix. Exempting the versioned tree instead
would leave the whole trust-root set ungraded; grading it against the flat
convention would mark upstream's own namespace as a violation.

No single expected form is hardcoded: each file's expected ``$id`` is derived
from the tree it lives in, plus the one recorded exception above — so advancing
a pin cannot leave this module asserting a form upstream stopped shipping.

GH #1881 flagged that ``_refresh.py`` wrote the fetched body verbatim with no
``$id`` check and no documented convention, so running the documented refresh
procedure could regress a file with nothing turning red until a downstream
reader tripped over it much later. This module grades both halves — the
artifacts on disk obey their convention, and ``_refresh.py``'s guard actually
rejects a violation. Both offline: no clone, no network.
