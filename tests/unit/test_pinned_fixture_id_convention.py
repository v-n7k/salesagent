"""The vendored AdCP fixture keeps upstream's ``$id`` verbatim, and the
refresh script refuses to write anything else.

``tests/fixtures/adcp_schemas_pinned/`` vendors exactly one frozen upstream
artifact — ``enums/error-code.json`` at ``PINNED_SHA``, kept only for its
``enumMetadata`` ``suggestion`` text (see ``_refresh.py``'s docstring). GH #1881
flagged that ``_refresh.py`` wrote the fetched body verbatim with no ``$id``
check and no documented convention, so running the documented refresh procedure
could regress the file with nothing turning red until a downstream reader
tripped over it much later.

The decided convention is upstream's own form, verbatim. At the current pin
(v3.1.1) that is the version-stamped ``/schemas/<version>/<category>/<name>.json``,
mirroring the file's own path under ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/``; the expected value is
derived from ``_refresh.PINNED_VERSION``, never hardcoded here, so advancing the
pin cannot leave this module asserting a form upstream stopped shipping. This
module grades both halves — the artifact on disk obeys it, and ``_refresh.py``'s
guard actually rejects a violation. Both offline: no clone, no network.
