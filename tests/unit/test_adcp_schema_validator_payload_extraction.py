"""AdCPSchemaValidator._extract_adcp_payload strips only genuinely non-spec fields.

Regression for PR #1838: the strip-set used to
remove "message", "context_id", and "errors" before validation, with a
comment claiming they're transport-layer additions "not part of the AdCP
spec". All three are genuine spec-defined properties on the pinned schema's
response envelope (message/context_id on the "Protocol Envelope" allOf branch
every bundled *-response.json schema shares; errors as a top-level property
on schemas like get-products-response.json, and required on the "failed"
oneOf branch of schemas like create-media-buy-response.json) — stripping them
meant the validator silently never graded their type/shape, and for
"errors" specifically, silently masked a payload that would otherwise fail
validation outright (a "failed" status response missing its required
"errors" array). "clarification_needed" has no spec basis and stays
stripped.
