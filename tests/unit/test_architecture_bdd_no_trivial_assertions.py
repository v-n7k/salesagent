"""Guard: BDD Then steps must make meaningful assertions, not just truthiness checks.

A Then step that only does ``assert ctx.get("response")`` checks existence but
not correctness. Meaningful assertions use comparisons (==, !=, is, in),
isinstance checks, or call helper functions that contain real assertions.

**Rule**: Every @then step must contain at least one "meaningful" assertion:
  - ``assert x == y`` / ``assert x != y`` / ``assert x is y`` / ``assert x is not y``
  - ``assert x in y`` / ``assert x not in y``
  - ``assert isinstance(x, Y)``
  - ``assert len(x) == n`` (comparison, not bare ``assert len(x)``)
  - Or delegate to a helper function (function call in body)

A bare ``assert expr`` without a comparison operator is "trivial" — it only
checks truthiness, not a specific expected value.

**Second rule — REACHABILITY**: a Then must not merely CONTAIN a meaningful
assertion, it must not be able to RETURN without executing one.

Containment was not enough. ``then_no_dry_run_include`` held
``assert dry_run is None`` — a meaningful comparison, so the presence rule
passed it — with the whole body under ``if resp is not None:`` and no ``else``.
On an errored dispatch the payload is None, the body is skipped, and the step
returns having asserted nothing. That reads in a report exactly like a scenario
that verified its claim (GH #1802).

The check is accessor-agnostic on purpose: it looks at control flow, not at
which reader produced the value, so it catches the same shape whether the guard
came from ``payload_or_none``, ``ctx.get(...)`` or ``hasattr``. Legislating
which accessor a step chose would be a style rule, and a step that dereferences
a lenient reader already fails — just with a worse message.

**Two stated limits.** Both are boundaries of what control flow can decide, not
oversights, and naming them is cheaper than a reader discovering them:

1. A step that takes SOME verdict and then returns early past its OWN claim is
   not caught — ``resp = require_payload(ctx)`` already raises on an absent
   payload, so a later ``if not resp.accounts: return`` leaves the rule
   satisfied while the specific claim goes ungraded. Separating "a verdict" from
   "the verdict this step's text promises" needs the step text, not the AST.
2. A ``for`` body counts as terminating, which is a deliberate limit rather
   than an oversight: a loop over an empty collection also returns without
asserting, but that is a distinct shape with its own census (15 sites, filed
separately) and folding it in would have widened this sweep from 10 sites to 25.
Removing ``ast.For`` from the terminator set below is the one-line
generalization once those are fixed (GH: filed as its own bug).

What the rule DOES catch is the shape that produced GH #1802's finding and is
proven by mutation in this module's own history: every assertion under an ``if``
with no ``else``, at any nesting depth, whatever accessor produced the value.
