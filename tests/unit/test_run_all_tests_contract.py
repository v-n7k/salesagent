"""Contract test for run_all_tests.sh argument handling.

Guards PR #1420 review finding #2: the in-network runner replaced the
historical MODE contract (``ci`` default / ``quick`` / targeted) with a raw tox
suite-list, so ``./run_all_tests.sh ci`` became ``tox -e ci`` ->
"provided environments not found: ci", breaking Makefile quality-full/test-full
and the documented commands.

Asserts the resolved contract via the ``RUN_ALL_TESTS_RESOLVE_ONLY`` seam so no
Docker stack is needed.
