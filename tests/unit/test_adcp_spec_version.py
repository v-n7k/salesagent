    ``...115782+00:00`` are the same instant, both valid RFC 3339, and the pinned schemas
    constrain neither (``adagents.json`` :110-113 says only
    ``{"type": "string", "format": "date-time"}``). Only a byte comparison can see the
    difference — which is how the regression was caught, by an assertion that compared
    bytes rather than parsing them.

    THE FAULT THIS EXISTS FOR (#1757). ``src/core/signing/_rfc3339.py`` was created because
    this codebase already shipped two formatters that "happen to agree today" — its own
    docstring says so. Routing two of the four documents through pinned SDK models
    re-created that from the other side: pydantic renders ``...Z``, ``rfc3339()`` renders
    ``...+00:00``. Because ``build_adagents_json`` embeds the same ``_published_jwk``
    output while adagents itself is not converted, ONE ORIGIN was serving both spellings.

    So the invariant is "exactly one spelling", not "the old spelling" — and it is held by
    construction: the serializers CALL ``rfc3339()`` rather than re-implementing
    ``isoformat()``, because a second implementation that agrees today is the fault itself.
