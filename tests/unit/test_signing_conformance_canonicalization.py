"""L1(b) — the 31 URL-canonicalization cases, through the signing layer's PUBLIC surface.

#1291 B3 (``salesagent-z6nr.14``), re-scoped by ``salesagent-z6nr.33``. ``chopmob-cloud``
noted on #1291 that cross-implementation signing-base parity is where RFC 9421
implementations actually break; ``canonicalization.json`` pins exactly that, so it runs
as its own parametrized case set rather than folded into the request vectors.

The graded surface is the layer's canonicalization seam —
:mod:`src.core.signing.canonical` — whose canonicalizers delegate to the repo's ONE
vendored copy of the merged upstream fixes (``src/vendor/adcp_canonical``, adcp 7.0.2
verbatim, carrying upstream #977/#978/#979) behind the comparer-side gate. Asserting
straight against ``adcp.signing`` would keep assertions permanently red until an SDK
bump; asserting against the seam grades what callers actually get, whichever side
provides it — which is the layer's whole contract. The layer still never RE-DERIVES a
canonical form: the vendored module is upstream's own code, not a third canonicalizer.

The seam, NOT ``src.core.signing`` itself: that package's ``__init__`` is deliberately
empty (no re-exports, so the ``metrics``/``verifier`` import cycle cannot close), so
"the layer's public surface" is the dotted module path. This file grades the COMPARER
side. ``tests/unit/test_url_canonicalization_vectors.py`` grades the vendored copy
against the raw vectors and the PRODUCER seam (``canonical_agent_url``) against the
spec's equivalences — a different set of obligations on a different vector file, which
is why both exist.

Arithmetic, said out loud so nothing is quietly dropped
------------------------------------------------------
**29 of 31 cases run as conformance through the facade; 2 run as our-obligation
blocker tests. 31 accounted for, 0 skipped, 0 xfailed.**

The 2 are comparer-obligation cases, deliberately not implementable as written:

* ``idn-to-punycode`` and ``idn-mixed-case-to-punycode`` are SIGNER-side.
  ``url-canonicalization.mdx`` step 2: a host containing raw non-ASCII bytes "MUST be
  rejected by the comparer — receivers do not silently re-normalize". The
  punycode-MAPPING half is the signing path's (the vendored ``_canon_host`` performs
  it there); OUR surface is the comparer, whose obligation is the REJECTION — that is
  what the blocker tests below assert. (Same obligation request vector 026 grades.)

``trailing-empty-query-preserved`` GRADUATED to conformance with the vendored #979
fix (``salesagent-z6nr.33``): the seam receives URL strings and now preserves the
trailing ``?``. The ASGI boundary still collapses the distinction — see
``test_trailing_empty_query_is_collapsed_at_the_asgi_boundary``, which records that
asymmetry deliberately.

Neither blocker test asserts the SDK's current output. A test that pins today's wrong
answer locks the bug in — that is the one thing this file must never do.

Error code: the 6 ``reject: true`` cases expect ``request_target_uri_malformed``
(the DATA), grounded at ``url-canonicalization.mdx`` — "Malformed authorities are
rejected with ``request_target_uri_malformed`` on the signing path". The vector
README's worked example is STALE and shows ``request_signature_header_malformed``;
the data wins, so do not "correct" these assertions from the prose. Keep the two
codes apart: request vector ``negative/026`` legitimately expects
``request_signature_header_malformed``. The ``request_target_uri_malformed`` constant
is ABSENT from ``adcp==6.6.0``, which is why the layer defines it.
