"""tests/helpers/pinned_schema.py must resolve to the SAME AdCP spec version
the installed adcp SDK is pinned to — not an independently vendored SHA.

Regression for PR #1838, reframed as a tier-1 DRY defect:
pinned_schema.py vendored its own frozen schema tree
(tests/fixtures/adcp_schemas_pinned/, pinned to
adcontextprotocol/adcp@04f59d2d5 / tag v3.1-04f59d2d5, the 3.1.0-beta.3 era)
independently of the installed adcp SDK's own pin (pyproject.toml, currently
6.6.0 / spec 3.1.1) — a full minor-track behind and already diverged (e.g.
get-products-response.json: 12 properties vendored vs 17 in the SDK's tree;
enums/error-code.json: 64 codes vendored vs 92 in the SDK's tree). A spec
bump that touches one pin and not the other ships tests grading two
different specs with no signal.

This test doesn't care HOW pinned_schema.py resolves a schema (the SDK's
plain tree or something else) — only that whatever it resolves comes from
the SAME physical directory the installed SDK ships, so there is exactly ONE
upstream pin in play, and that resolved schemas carry properties only the
SDK's current (3.1.1) tree has, never the old vendored fixture.
