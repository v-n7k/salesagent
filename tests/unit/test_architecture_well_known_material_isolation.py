"""Guard: NO handler in well_known.py resolves signing MATERIAL.

#1291 A5 follow-up, salesagent-z6nr.27. The architect review flagged that the
"narrowed seam" invariant (only the revocation-list handler decrypts a
private key; the other three secret-free bootstrap documents never do)
rested on convention, not enforcement — the shared ``DocumentBuilder`` type
hands every handler the whole ``TrustRootUoW``, so any handler COULD call
``resolve_signing_material``/``_resolve_signing_provider`` without a type
error. This guard makes the invariant executable: an AST scan of
``src/routes/well_known.py`` for calls to either name. The bar has since
gone UP from "exactly one named function" to NONE — see
:func:`test_no_handler_resolves_signing_material` — because the one handler
that legitimately needed material now reaches it through a single layer
operation instead of resolving it here.

Re-admitting even ONE call site here (or moving the call into ``_serve`` /
``_build_document``, the shared helpers every handler invokes) is exactly
the regression this guard exists to catch: it would mean a
currently-unauthenticated, secret-free
bootstrap route (brand.json/adagents.json/jwks.json) started resolving
private key material on every GET — a DoS-adjacent amplification surface on
routes whose module docstring justifies their lack of auth by carrying no
secret.

    The invariant is unchanged and its bar went UP. Material resolution moved out of this
    module entirely, into ``src.core.signing.revocation_list.publishable_revocation_list``
    (a dotted path, because ``src/core/signing/__init__.py`` re-exports nothing) — the route now
    calls ONE layer operation instead of assembling resolve -> read -> build -> sign
    itself. So no handler here touches private key material, not even the one that
    legitimately needed to.

    This is not the guard going quiet because its subject vanished: the companion test
    below pins that the revocation handler still reaches the material-resolving operation,
    so "nobody resolves material" cannot be satisfied by the document silently ceasing to
