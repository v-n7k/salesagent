"""Regression tests for : silent return [] masks agent failures.

A creative-agent fetch failure must surface as an error in
``FormatFetchResult.errors``, never as a silently empty format list — that
distinction is what lets ``products.py`` tell "agent up, genuinely 0 formats"
apart from "agent unreachable" and trigger graceful degradation accordingly.

``TestFetchFormatsAnomalousStatusesMustRaise`` (anomalous ``status`` values on
a mocked adcp SDK response) was retired by salesagent-4n88: the OPERATOR agent
path no longer goes through ``adcp.ADCPMultiAgentClient`` at all — there is no
SDK-shaped ``status`` field to be anomalous. The invariant this file guards —
a malformed/unparseable MCP response must raise, not silently validate into
"no formats" — is now enforced by ``_parse_mcp_tool_result`` (covered in
``test_creative_agent_fallback.py::TestParseMcpToolResult``), the one parser
both the operator and counterparty fetch paths share.

Bug: prebid/salesagent#1136
