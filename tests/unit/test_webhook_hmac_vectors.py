"""Grades our webhook HMAC signer/verifier against AdCP's own conformance vectors.

Source: ``tests/fixtures/adcp_webhook_vectors_pinned/webhook-hmac-sha256.json``,
vendored from ``adcontextprotocol/adcp`` at the repo's pinned spec tag (v3.1.1
-- see ``docs/adcp-spec-version.md`` and that fixture dir's ``_refresh.py``).
This turns "we changed the code" into "the wire is proven against the spec's
own test data" -- independent of any local test's own (possibly wrong)
expectations (salesagent-47n9.18).

Scope boundary -- excluded on purpose, not by oversight:

- The ``signer_side.rejection_vectors`` / ``signer_side.positive_vectors``
  blocks (salesagent-47n9.19) grade the strict-parse PRIMITIVE
  (``webhook_strict_json.loads_rejecting_duplicate_keys``), not the signer
  (``prepare_signed_request``) -- the signer never receives text (see the
  scope note below), so it is never on the code path these vectors exercise.
  ``TestSignerSideVectorsGradeThePrimitive`` names this explicitly: a green
  result here means the primitive matches the spec's own signer-conformance
  data, not that the signer has a runtime check it structurally cannot need
  (its dict-typed input already makes the disease this class of vector probes
  unrepresentable -- see ``src/core/security/webhook_egress.py``'s module
  docstring for the full argument). The verifier half of the duplicate-object-key
  rule IS graded end-to-end here, from the ``duplicate-keys-conflicting-values``
  entry in ``vectors``; see ``TestVerifierRejectsDuplicateObjectKeys``.
- ``secret_rejection_vectors``' two entropy vectors (all-zero, all-repeated-char)
  grade a SHOULD, not a MUST (spec text: "Implementations SHOULD reject
  well-known weak values"). Implementing that check was tried and reverted:
  it would reject ``"x" * 32``, which BR-UC-004's "Webhook credentials at
  minimum length - accepted" BDD scenario deliberately uses to pin the exact
  32-char MUST-accept boundary. Only the two MUST-level length vectors
  (31-byte, empty) are graded here; the entropy SHOULD is a separate,
  deliberately unscoped follow-up (avoids breaking a pinned BDD scenario for
  a task with no design-review atom).
- The signer (``prepare_signed_request``) only ever emits its own canonical
  compact-separator, ``ensure_ascii=True`` serialization of a payload dict --
  by the Core Invariant #1441 established, it never signs
  externally-supplied raw bytes. So it can only be graded against the subset
  of ``vectors`` whose ``raw_body`` IS byte-reproducible from a dict via that
  exact serialization (pure-ASCII, compact-form vectors); vectors in other
  JSON forms (spaced, pretty-printed, unicode, empty-body, embedded nulls,
  trailing newline) are verifier-only -- there is nothing in the signer to
  grade them against. This is a scope boundary from the architecture, not a
  gap: the verifier (byte-transparent) is graded against every remaining
  vector regardless of form.

    Not reachable from ``vectors``: every one of the 14 accept vectors is

    so the narrowing branch in ``verify_webhook`` (``return payload if

    fixture -- reverting it to a bare ``return payload`` leaves the rest of
    this file, and the whole suite, green. This class is that branch's grader.

    The obligation: ``None`` carries exactly ONE meaning -- "the signature
    verified and the body carries no JSON-object payload" -- so a top-level
    array/scalar must not leak its parsed value back to a caller that has
    been told to expect ``dict[str, Any] | None``. The ``json-null`` case is

    ``None`` even before the narrowing, since ``json.loads(b"null")`` is
    ``None``); the array and scalar cases are the ones that regress if the
    narrowing is dropped.

    Signing goes through the SDK's ``sign_legacy_webhook`` rather than our own
    ``prepare_signed_request`` because the latter is dict-typed by Core
    Invariant #1441 and so structurally cannot emit a non-object
