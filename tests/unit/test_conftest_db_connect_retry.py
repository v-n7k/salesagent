"""Regression test for the test-stack DB connect-retry helper (salesagent-qpst).

Targets the behaviour of ``tests.conftest_db._connect_with_retry`` directly:
the parallel-tox port-collision race is non-deterministic and cannot be
reproduced as a deterministic failing test, so we inject the failure mode
(``psycopg2.OperationalError``) and assert the helper's contract:

1. transient OperationalError -> retried, then the real connection is returned
2. persistent failure -> a CLEAR, bounded RuntimeError (never infinite, never a
   raw psycopg2 traceback surfacing on a random test)

This is the legitimate unit-test case: the unit under test *is* the retry/
backoff helper; an integration repro of the race would itself be flaky.
