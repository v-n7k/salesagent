"""Guard: the two UC-004 circuit-breaker scenarios are graded on the live stack (#2060).

``@T-UC-004-webhook-circuit-open`` and ``@T-UC-004-webhook-circuit-recovery``
claim to grade the webhook circuit breaker over ``e2e_rest``. They grade a
dictionary in the test process: the Given steps seed ``_circuit_breakers``
through the harness's breaker write seam, and the Then steps read the same
object back. Under ``e2e_rest`` the server runs in its own container holding its
own ``WebhookDeliveryService``, so the server's breaker is never touched — and
``tests/bdd/conftest.py`` routes both tags through a NON-STRICT xfail, which
turns any outcome at all into a green run.

Two cushions — evidence the test process manufactured for itself, and an xfail
that forgives any outcome — and the scenarios cannot fail on the transport that
matters until both are gone. This guard is the standing check that they are:

1. Neither tag is xfail-routed on ``e2e_rest`` (the routing set in
   ``tests/bdd/conftest.py``, or the ``e2e_rest`` known-failures ledger).
2. No step bound to either scenario reaches the harness's breaker WRITE seam —
   the four methods that fake breaker state in the test process.
3. No step bound to either scenario READS breaker state out of the test process
   either. Under ``e2e_rest`` those accessors build a fresh in-process
   ``WebhookDeliveryService``, disconnected from the deployed server's breaker,
   so an assertion on what they return is an assertion about an object the
   scenario itself just created.

WHAT THIS GUARD DOES NOT PROVE. It grades the STRUCTURAL acceptance criteria of
#2060 ("neither scenario seeds ``_circuit_breakers`` in the test
process on any transport", and "both scenarios run on ``e2e_rest`` without an
xfail marker"), plus the read-side half of the same Core Invariant. It says
nothing about the behavioural criteria — that the DEPLOYED
server's breaker opens after real rejected deliveries and then suppresses real
ones. That is a cross-process property, and the only artifact that can grade it
is a bdd-in-network run in which both node ids appear as plain PASS:

* ``test_persistent_webhook_failures_open_circuit_breaker[e2e_rest]``
* ``test_circuit_breaker_closes_after_successful_recovery_probes[e2e_rest]``

And a plain PASS on those node ids is not the end of it either. Both scenarios
XPASSED on e2e_rest for years while grading nothing, so "it passes in-network"
is the claim under suspicion, not the answer to it. The anti-vacuity guarantee
is the mutation check — scripts/mutation-check-webhook-breaker.sh — which
deletes ``circuit_breaker.record_failure()`` from the server, rebuilds its
image, and requires the OPEN leg to REDDEN. Until that runs, nothing here or
in-network shows the breaker works.

A source scan is a substitute for none of that. It is the part of the claim that
is checkable without a Docker stack, and it fails the build the moment either
cushion comes back.
