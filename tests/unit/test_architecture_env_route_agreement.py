"""Grader: the two env-route resolvers must agree, per COLLECTED scenario.

The structural half of this lane — one owner, one routing call, the four routing
helpers absorbed — lives in ``test_architecture_liveness_contract_owner.py``.
This module grades the BEHAVIOR the lane exists to fix: the verdict
``tests/bdd/conftest.py::_harness_env`` dispatches on and the verdict
``scripts/audit/scenario_liveness_join`` publishes must be the SAME verdict for
the same scenario.

## Why this is parametrized over collected scenarios, not over ``ENV_ROUTES``

The registry has 7 rows and the two lookups already AGREE on every one of them,
so a table-parametrized test is green before AND after and could never detect
the disagreement. The disagreement lives entirely in what is NOT a row: six
marker-set-keyed prose branches in ``_harness_env``, invisible to
``scenario_liveness_join.registry_wired`` — and a marker SET is not expressible
as a "tag combination in the table" at all. So the input is the real collected
``tests/bdd`` suite: every scenario's tag + MARKER set, taken from a real
``pytest --collect-only`` run (the same shape as
``tests/integration/test_bdd_scenario_liveness_real_run.py``'s narrow slices),
grouped per feature module so a failure names the module it is in.

## The negative obligation (F1c.1)

Covering the positive case alone is what let the degenerate reading — "a UC
``_detect_uc`` recognizes but ``ENV_ROUTES`` has no row for is routed-by-branch,
therefore wired" — pass an earlier draft of this grader. Each of those six UCs
also carries an ``else: pytest.xfail("... not yet wired")`` catch-all, so the
degenerate reading reports those scenarios wired TOO, converting today's
false-DORMANT into a false-LIVE. ``conftest.py:3472-3474`` documents the
magnitude in the other direction: "Dropping this line is what flipped ~800
dormant scenarios from xfail to fail."

So one CATCH-ALL scenario per branch UC is pinned below, by exact tag, and must
resolve NOT-wired on both sides.

UC-004 is the documented exception, stated rather than dropped: its catch-all
(``conftest.py:3715``) is UNREACHABLE today — ``_detect_delivery_harness``
is total over the four handled harness types, returning "poll" as its fallback,
so no collected UC-004 scenario can reach it. The obligation is therefore
authored in its only true form for that branch (every collected UC-004 scenario
resolves WIRED on both sides), which fails just as loudly if the move loses a
scenario. See ``test_uc004_catch_all_is_unreachable_so_all_of_it_resolves_wired``.
