"""Guard: no module holding a webhook signature header may send it via json=.

KEPT DELIBERATELY, with the measurement that decided it. A proposal retired this
guard on the grounds that its subject "became a type error" when the seam was
typed. Measured instead of assumed: write the violation into ``src/`` and run
mypy, and mypy ACCEPTS it — ``json=`` survives on both ``send`` and ``asend``
alongside ``content: bytes | None``, so a third signer in this shape is still
perfectly representable. This guard is live protection, not residue.

#1441 deleted the two signers (``WebhookAuthenticator.sign_payload``,
``WebhookDeliveryService._generate_hmac_signature``) that recreated the
signed-bytes-vs-wire-bytes divergence bug: each computed an HMAC over one
serialization of a payload dict, then handed the SAME dict to
``send(..., json=payload)``, letting httpx re-serialize it independently — a
receiver verifying the signature against the bytes it actually received
rejected every delivery. Deleting those two signers makes the OLD bug
unconstructible, but nothing stops a THIRD signer from being written tomorrow
in the same shape. This guard closes that class going forward: no module under
``src/`` may hold a computed ``X-*-Signature`` header key and also call
``send``/``asend`` with ``json=`` — the only sound pattern is
``src.core.security.webhook_egress.deliver_webhook``/``adeliver_webhook``
(both of which are ``prepare_signed_request`` + ``content=`` internally, the
shape any other caller must use directly), which serializes once and
transmits exactly those bytes.

What counts as a violation: a module that (a) uses a string matching
``X-*-Signature`` (case-insensitive) as a dict KEY — a headers-dict subscript
assignment or a dict literal — AND (b) calls ``send``/``asend`` with a
``json=`` keyword, anywhere in the same module. Same one-hop, same-module
scope as ``test_architecture_no_call_site_backoff.py`` — a guard is not a
call graph.

What does NOT count, deliberately: the string appearing only in a docstring
or comment (prose, not a header-dict key) — this module's own docstring
mentions ``X-*-Signature`` and must not self-flag. A module that holds a
signature-header key but sends via ``content=`` (the correct shape). A module
that calls ``send``/``asend`` with ``json=`` but never computes a signature
header (Slack notifications, vendor callbacks with no HMAC).
