# GAMOrdersManager are imported INSIDE _run_approval_thread (never module-level
# attributes to substitute), and `AdapterConfig` is not a name this service has at
# all any more -- the adapter row is read through AdapterConfigRepository. Requesting
# it would have raised AttributeError at patch time, so it is deleted rather than
# left as a trap. The GAM approval path is graded against a real DB in
# tests/integration/test_order_approval_background.py.


# test_start_approval_creates_sync_job lived here. It asserted the SyncJob's fields off
# a MagicMock session's call_args (never a persisted row) and left the worker thread
# running past the end of the test, where it reached the real DB and fired a webhook
# into whatever test ran next (found and fixed in GH #1941). Replaced by the real-DB path in
# tests/integration/test_order_approval_background.py, which joins the thread.
#
# Retained from the parallel fix on main (#2091), because the diagnosis is recorded
# nowhere else and explains why a leaked worker is not merely untidy: the stray thread
# ran the true retry path -- order_approval_service.py:406 `time.sleep(2**attempt)`
# behind httpx POSTs at timeout=10.0 -- so it called sleep(1), sleep(2), sleep(4) from
# inside whatever test was running by then. Measured: still alive ~1500 tests later,
# during test_performance_index_behavioral and test_policy_typed_models, and it
# intermittently broke TestWebhookDelivery::test_exponential_backoff_timing, whose
# class-level patch of `src.core.webhook_delivery.time.sleep` is PROCESS-GLOBAL (that
# module does `import time`, so the patch lands on the time module itself and is visible
# to every module and every thread). The stray sleeps inflated mock_sleep.call_count
# past 2. main's fix patched `_run_approval_thread` so the thread never spawns; this
# branch deleted the test instead, because its assertions read a mock rather than a row.

# Two webhook unit tests that lived here were REMOVED, not repaired, when
# ``_send_approval_webhook`` stopped speaking httpx and started handing the URL
# to the egress seam (``src.core.security.outbound_http.send``):
#
#   * ``test_webhook_notification_sent_on_success`` claimed: the payload carries
#     event/media_buy_id/status/order_id/attempts, and a stored bearer
#     PushNotificationConfig becomes ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``. It read
#     those off a substituted ``httpx.Client``, plus (from #1697)
#     ``httpx.Client(timeout=10.0, follow_redirects=False)`` — a constructor the
#     module no longer calls at all. Regraded against a real origin in
#     ``tests/integration/test_order_approval_webhook.py``
#     (``TestDeliveredPayload``, ``TestStoredCredential`` — which also covers the
#     no-config direction the old test only hit incidentally).
#   * ``test_webhook_retries_on_failure`` claimed: a failing POST is retried to
#     three attempts. The hand-rolled ``for attempt in range(...)`` /
#     ``time.sleep(2 ** attempt)`` loop it patched no longer exists; the seam owns
#     attempt count, retry classification and BR-RULE-029 backoff. Regraded in
#     ``tests/integration/test_order_approval_webhook.py``
#     (``TestRetryClassification``, ``TestExhaustedDeliveryIsSilent``) and, for
#     the spacing, once in ``tests/integration/test_outbound_http.py``.
#
# The SSRF obligation from #1697 stays here because it is a claim about THIS
# call site — that the order-approval sender shares the gate — which the seam's
# own suite cannot make on its behalf.

    runs — the link-local metadata address is refused inside the seam before any

    escape hatches on), and production swallows the refusal as a log line.

    The defect (#2056): `_active_approvals` holds the thread but exposes no way
    to stop it. A started thread runs the real webhook retry path -- backoff
    behind HTTP POSTs that time out after 10 s -- so it outlives the request,
    and the test, by tens of seconds. Measured: a thread from
    `test_start_approval_creates_sync_job` called sleep(1) and sleep(2) during
    `test_performance_index_behavioral` and `test_policy_typed_models`, roughly
    1500 tests later, landing inside another test's mock because
    `src/core/webhook_delivery.py` imports `time` and patching
    `src.core.webhook_delivery.time.sleep` replaces it process-wide.

    `delivery_simulator.stop_simulation` and gam/managers/reporting already
    solve this with a parallel `_stop_signals` Event dict beside the registry;
    this service is the third site and never got one.

    What this test grades is the registry half, and that half is unchanged by
    the move of outbound HTTP behind the egress seam: a started approval must
    expose a stop signal, a caller must be able to set it, and the thread must
    be joinable once it is set. The seam owns the backoff now and offers no
    cancellation hook, so production checks the signal before handing a
    delivery over rather than inside a loop it no longer has -- which is why
    the worker below is substituted, and no HTTP path is exercised here.

    The import is inside the test on purpose: in the red state it fails here,
    before any thread is started, so a failing run does not itself leak the
    thread this test exists to bound.
