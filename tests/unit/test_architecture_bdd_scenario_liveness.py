"""Regression tests for tests/bdd/scenario_liveness.py.

The parent finding: a ``@storyboard-v3.1``-tagged scenario
whose steps have no bound step definitions is converted to ``xfail`` by
``tests/bdd/conftest.py``'s auto-xfail hookwrapper and counts as "covered" in
``storyboard_coverage_map`` forever — nothing measures whether the scenario
actually runs. ``scenario_liveness.py`` fixes the measurement by emitting a
per-run artifact from a real BDD invocation. This file pins the pure logic
(reason classification, identifier/transport extraction, the
``ScenarioLiveness`` record's aggregation rules) offline, without running
pytest-bdd. The real-run proof — that a genuinely unbound scenario is recorded
as such, and a genuinely bound one is not — lives in
``tests/integration/test_bdd_scenario_liveness_real_run.py``, which shells out
to a real narrow ``pytest tests/bdd`` slice against Postgres.
