"""Unit tests for SSRF-adjacent URL handling (F-04).

``TestCheckUrlSsrf`` and ``TestBlockedHostnames`` — the direct tests of
``check_url_ssrf``/``BLOCKED_HOSTNAMES`` — are DELETED: that module
(``src.core.security.url_validator``) no longer exists (salesagent-tbrk.1).
Every row's behavioral content migrated into
``tests/integration/test_outbound_http.py``'s verdict-parity table (see that
file's ``EgressPolicy.check_registration`` cases), which grades the SAME
address predicate now shared by both the registration and dial verdicts —
triaged row-by-row so nothing was silently dropped:

- localhost / metadata / docker / gateway-docker hostname rows -> the
  blocked-hostname parity rows.
- loopback, RFC1918 x3, link-local, 224.0.0.1, ``[ff02::1]``,
  ``[64:ff9b::...]`` -> the reserved-range parity rows.
- CGNAT literal -> the supplement-range parity rows (this is the row that
  used to pass ONLY because ``url_validator.BLOCKED_NETWORKS`` covered it —
  now covered by the shared predicate on both verdicts, closing
  the gap recorded in #1792).
- non-http / file scheme / require_https -> the non-https parity rows.
- ``valid_public_https_url_accepted`` -> the accepted half of the
  unresolvable-hostname divergence case.
- ``test_unresolvable_hostname_rejected`` (the ``resolve_dns=True`` DNS
  branch — dropped as dead code, one production caller, always
  ``resolve_dns=False``) -> its live semantics are preserved by the DIAL half
  of that same divergence case: an unresolvable host IS refused, via the
  SDK's single pinned resolution.
- ``valid_public_http_url_accepted`` (``require_https=False``) -> genuinely
  dead; the one production caller always passed ``require_https=True``.
  Nothing to migrate.

Covers:
- validate_agent_url: media_buy_create wrapper (format-only, unrelated to the
  address-policy migration above)
- Flask endpoint-level wiring for signals agents add/edit handlers (routes
  through ``src.admin.utils.url_policy`` -> ``outbound_http.validate_url``,
  never called ``check_url_ssrf`` directly)
