"""Guard: BDD Then steps must not dispatch requests (When-inside-Then).

Then steps assert on OUTCOMES (response, DB state). They must never send
a new request — that's a When action. When a Then step calls
``env.call_impl()``, ``env.call_via()``, ``dispatch_request()``, or
constructs an ``httpx.Client``, it is performing an action, not verifying
an outcome.

**Wrong** (Then sends request to test enforcement)::

    @then("auth should fire before business logic")
    def then_auth_first(ctx):
        req = CreateMediaBuyRequest(**ctx["request_kwargs"])
        env.call_impl(req=req, identity=bad_identity)  # ← When action!
        assert auth_error ...

**Right** (separate When step for the second request)::

    @when("the Buyer sends a request with invalid credentials")
    def when_bad_creds(ctx):
        env.call_impl(req=req, identity=bad_identity)

    @then("the system should reject with authentication error")
    def then_auth_error(ctx):
        assert ctx["error"] is AdCPAuthenticationError

Reading ``request_kwargs`` to derive expectations is fine — Then steps
need to know what was requested to verify the response is correct.

**Pattern 2 — Asserting on request data**:

A Then step that reads ``request_kwargs`` and asserts the request-derived
value against a constant (``assert expected_count > 0``) is testing the
Given step setup, not the system. These precondition checks belong in
the Given step that created the data, not the Then step.

**Wrong** (asserting request had creative IDs)::

    expected_count = sum(len(pkg["creative_ids"]) for pkg in request_kwargs["packages"])
    assert expected_count > 0  # ← testing Given, not production

**Right** (assert in Given, or derive from ctx contract)::

    # Given step:
    ctx["expected_creative_ids"] = {"c1", "c2"}
    assert ctx["expected_creative_ids"]  # precondition HERE

    # Then step:
    assert db_count == len(ctx["expected_creative_ids"])
