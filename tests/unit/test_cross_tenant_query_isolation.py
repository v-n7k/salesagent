"""Reproduction tests for cross-tenant query leaks.

After the composite PK migration (bfbf084c), IDs like principal_id, creative_id,
media_buy_id, and package_id are no longer globally unique. Every query on a
tenant-scoped model MUST include tenant_id in the WHERE clause.

Note: MediaPackage has NO tenant_id column — its PK is (media_buy_id, package_id).
Tenant isolation comes through the media_buy_id FK to MediaBuy (globally unique PK).
MediaPackage queries filtered by media_buy_id are inherently tenant-safe.

These tests use AST scanning to verify that select() calls include tenant_id.
Each test class maps to one beads bug.

# spelling to scan: the resolver loads the principal through PrincipalRepository, whose
# tenant_id is constructor-bound and applied by every select in it
# (repositories/principal.py). Two mechanisms hold what the scan held:
#   - structurally, ruff-boundary.toml's TID251 ban on src.core.database.models.Principal
#     (43a205a72) makes a raw select on the model unwritable outside the repositories
#     package, so there is no un-scoped lookup to find;
#   - behaviourally, on the wire, by BR-SECURITY-002-tenant-isolation.feature --
#     @T-SECURITY-002-credential-does-not-cross-tenants grades both directions of a
#     credential minted for one tenant being refused (AUTH_INVALID) by the other, and
#     @T-SECURITY-002-own-tenant-only grades that a buyer sees its own tenant's products
#     AND no other tenant's, which is the leak this scan was a proxy for.
