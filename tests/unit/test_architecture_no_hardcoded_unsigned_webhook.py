"""Structural guard: no webhook-signing seam call may hardcode an unsigned secret.

Backstops salesagent-47n9.15: ``order_approval_service.py`` called the signing
seam with a LITERAL ``None`` secret -- never deriving it from the stored
``PushNotificationConfig`` -- so a config that asked for
``authentication_type == "HMAC-SHA256"`` signing was silently delivered
unsigned, with no error. The fix threads a config-derived ``secret`` through
instead. This guard AST-scans every call to the function that IS the signing
seam (``prepare_signed_request`` -- see src/core/security/webhook_egress.py)
and fails if any call site hardcodes a literal ``None`` for the secret
argument. A caller that genuinely wants an unsigned delivery must still reach
the seam through a NAME bound to an expression that says why (e.g.
``secret = None  # explicitly unauthenticated``) -- but no *call site* may
spell the literal directly, because that is exactly the shape that let this
bug hide for three independent webhook implementations before it was caught
by a disease scan, not a test failure.

The allowlist is empty and expected to stay empty: the disposition table in
salesagent-47n9.15's codebase-scan atom found exactly one instance (the bug
itself, MIGRATEd by this same PR) and zero others.

# secret to ``prepare_signed_request`` -- which IS the call this guard inspects. Listing
# them would be meaningless: there is no secret argument at those calls to look at.
