"""Guard: every outbound AdCP webhook SENDER goes through the one signing boundary.

#1291 C1 (``salesagent-z6nr.18``), design step 6, last bullet — and the reason it
is written this way is a measured hole, not a style preference:

    A guard counting ``sign_webhook`` call sites passes with five senders and two
    routed. That hole is exactly what let ``order_approval_service`` exist as a
    fourth, unsigned AdCP webhook sender for as long as it did (salesagent-98t2) —
    nobody was counting SENDERS.

So this guard enumerates senders. It AST-discovers every outbound HTTP POST in
``src/`` whose destination is DYNAMIC (a name or attribute, not a literal or
f-string — i.e. a URL somebody else supplied rather than a fixed API path), and
requires every one of them to be classified in one of the three tables below. A
new POST to a caller-supplied URL anywhere in ``src/`` therefore fails this guard
until someone states which kind it is.

Of the three kinds, only :data:`ADCP_WEBHOOK_SENDERS` is subject to the boundary
rule: those destinations come from a buyer's own registration (a
``PushNotificationConfig`` row, an account notification subscriber, or the mock
adapter's async-completion URL), so what they carry is an AdCP webhook and the
receiver's registration selects how it is authenticated. When C1 routes a sender
through ``src.core.security.webhook_egress.deliver_webhook`` /
``adeliver_webhook`` — the one seam whose three-arm ``_headers_for`` reads that
registration and decides HMAC, Bearer or the RFC 9421 profile — its hand-rolled
POST DISAPPEARS: the sender stops being discovered here at all. That is the pass
condition, and it is not fakeable by adding a call somewhere in the module: the
raw POST has to go.

``ALLOWED_UNROUTED`` therefore holds only the senders that are still UNSIGNED, each of
which must carry a ``FIXME(#1291)`` at its source location so the debt is visible
where the code is, not only in this table. Per the repository's allowlist rule,
it can only shrink.

A sender that cannot use the DELIVERY act moves its POST into the boundary module rather
than earning an exemption where it stands. The proof-of-control challenge (#1291 C2) is
the case, and for structural reasons that survive the architecture change: it is not a
webhook delivery at all. Its schema forbids extra properties, so it cannot carry the
``idempotency_key`` a delivery stamps; it is a single attempt on a 2.0s budget rather than
the delivery ladder; and it is ALWAYS signed, with no legacy arm for a registration to
select (``sync_accounts.mdx`` @ v3.1.1 :207 — the challenge uses the seller's 9421
webhook-profile key EVEN WHEN the candidate config selects legacy delivery auth). Its send
therefore lives in :data:`BOUNDARY_MODULE`, which the scan skips, and which
:meth:`TestOutboundWebhookSenderBoundary.test_the_boundary_signs_what_it_sends` holds to
signing everything it sends. Exemption plus positive check, not exemption alone.

Known blind spots, measured by mutation rather than assumed (#1291 sweep):
a destination written as an INTERPOLATED f-string (``client.post(f"{config.url}",
...)``) is skipped as a "fixed API path", and a POST issued as
``client.send(client.build_request("POST", config.url, ...))`` is not a ``.post``
call at all. Both slip this detector. Closing the f-string case means classifying
the 15 adapter call sites that legitimately build a path under their own base URL,
which is a deliberate decision rather than a typo fix — so it is tracked, not done
here. The bare-name and ``requests.request`` shapes ARE caught; see
:class:`TestSenderDetector`.

#: ``src/`` and classifies by ``(path, destination)`` — would re-discover it at the new

#:
#: The path was ``src/core/signing/webhook_sender_factory.py`` while the epic still built an
#: ``adcp.webhooks.WebhookSender``. That factory does not exist here — the SDK sender opens
#: its own httpx client and is not a sanctioned dialer, so delivery routes through
#: ``src.core.security.webhook_egress`` instead — and the surface that survived it (which
#: KEY signs a tenant's outbound traffic, plus ``send_signed_challenge``) is
#: ``src/core/signing/outbound.py``. The name moved; the exemption and its paired check did
#: not change meaning.
#:
#: The exemption is not a hole, because it is paired with
#: :meth:`TestOutboundWebhookSenderBoundary.test_the_boundary_signs_what_it_sends` — a
#: POSITIVE check that this module's send takes its headers from a ``JwkSignerStrategy``.
