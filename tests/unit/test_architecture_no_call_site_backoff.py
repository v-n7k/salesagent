"""Guard: no exponential retry backoff computed outside the egress seam.

``src/core/security/outbound_http.py`` decides the retry schedule for every
outbound request: BR-RULE-029's 1s/2s/4s, each plus a ``uniform(0, 1)`` draw.
A call site that computes its own geometric delay is deciding that policy a
second time, and the two drift — which is exactly what happened before
#1802: one site slept 1/2/4, another skipped the 1s step entirely
and slept 2/4, and the seam itself slept 0.1/0.2/0.4 with no jitter at all. The
BDD step that was supposed to catch it only compared successive delays as a
ratio, so every one of those schedules passed.

This is the class-level counterpart to the egress import bans in
``ruff-egress.toml`` (TID251, run over ``src/`` by ``make quality-ci``).
Those bans stop a call site owning the *transport*; this one stops it owning
the *schedule*. They are separate diseases: a site can route through the seam
and still wrap it in its own retry loop (``src/core/utils/mcp_client.py`` does).

What counts as a violation: a ``sleep()`` whose duration is computed
geometrically. Three forms, because real code uses all three and a detector that
only read the inline one would report almost nothing:

- inline — ``time.sleep(2**attempt)``, ``time.sleep(min(5 * 2**attempt, 30))``
- via a local — ``backoff_time = 2**attempt`` then ``time.sleep(backoff_time)``
- via a helper in the same module — ``time.sleep(_backoff_seconds(attempt))``,
  which is the seam's own form (one hop only; a guard is not a call graph)

What does NOT count, deliberately:

- A constant or config-driven sleep: ``time.sleep(poll_interval)``,
  ``asyncio.sleep(SLEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS)``, ``time.sleep(0.5)``. Polling a
  remote that is *working*, pacing an SSE stream and ticking a scheduler are not
  retry schedules, and there are two dozen of them in ``src/``.
- Exponentiation that never reaches a sleep. The power has to flow into the
  duration, by one of the three routes above.

``NON_HTTP_BACKOFF`` is a taxonomy, not a debt list: every remaining entry is
a geometric sleep that is genuinely not outbound HTTP (a business-state poll,
a non-HTTP protocol, a database connection retry), so the seam is not where
it belongs. It only shrinks — a site migrating onto the seam removes its
entry — and it does not grow by exempting a real violation.
