"""Exact-set lock for the e2e_rest xfail escape hatches (PR #1430 review).

The e2e_rest known-failures ledger has an exact-set lock
(``test_e2e_rest_ledger_state.py``), so a still-failing scenario cannot be
silently added to or dropped from the ledger. But the ledger is only one of
four routes that take a failing e2e_rest scenario out of blocking grading:

1. the nodeid ledger (locked);
2. an ``is_e2e_rest``-gated xfail route in the BDD conftest's
   ``pytest_collection_modifyitems`` (tag/substring conditions);
3. an env-level ``E2EUnsupportedSetup`` declaration in ``tests/harness/``
   (translated to xfail by the conftest report hook);
4. never parametrizing e2e_rest at all, in ``pytest_generate_tests`` — the
   quietest of the four, because a transport dropped at collection is exactly
   as ungraded as an xfail while showing no marker anywhere (#1802).

Routes 2, 3 and 4 had no lock: a scenario relocated there escaped tracking
silently. This guard gives them the same exact-set treatment — adding OR
removing a route fails here, forcing a reviewable pin update in the same
change (the ledger discipline). There is deliberately no separate
``count <= len(pin)`` ratchet: the exact-set comparison already fails in both
directions, and a ceiling derived from the pin can never fail independently.

Route 4 is pinned four ways, because it can be written four ways: the gate
condition on the append (detector 3), the hook's call-site argument that
carries ``Transport.E2E_REST`` (detector 3), every early return or transports
rebind upstream of it, and the single-transport tag map.

Every detector is exercised by meta-tests below against known-bad synthetic
sources, so a detector regression cannot silently blind the lock (repo
precedent: #1498).

# parametrize-time drop neither detector 1 (pytest_collection_modifyitems xfail

# set; the merged conftest keeps that deletion, and
# tests/unit/test_e2e_rest_ssrf_blocked_scenario_collected.py proves
# behaviourally that the one scenario it used to drop
# (T-UC-004-webhook-ssrf-blocked) is collected on e2e_rest again — reachable
# because the outbound-egress seam's ADCP_TESTING loopback allowance lets the
# live stack dial the e2e capture receiver. This detector pins the gate so the
# drop cannot come back silently: a future `and not (marker_names &
# _SOME_NEW_TAGS)` changes the unparsed condition and fails the pin below.
#
# The gate is no longer written inside the hook. `_parametrize_ctx` (extracted
# so the AdCP branch and the admin branch share ONE append-e2e-when-enabled tail —
# duplicating it is the R0801 shape the DRY invariant treats as a defect) moved
# the append into a module-level function that appends a PARAMETER, so an
# `E2E_REST`-attribute scan anchored to `pytest_generate_tests` finds nothing at
# all. A detector that returns None there does not fail honestly, it fails
# BLIND, and the mismatch reads as drift. So the scan is module-wide and keys on
# the control-flow PROPERTY — an `if` that reads BDD_E2E_ENABLED and appends —
# rather than on where the append happens to be written; and a second pin covers
# the hook's call sites, which is where the merged shape lets you write the next
# drop: `None if <new condition> else Transport.E2E_REST`.

#: THE FIFTH ROUTE OUT OF LIVE GRADING, and the one route 3 cannot cover.
#:
#: ``E2EUnsupportedSetup`` is how this repo declares a setup unrealizable against a live
#: server — but the declaration mechanism lives in ``tests/harness/`` and detector 4's
#: scan is HARNESS-ONLY. A step body that reaches into ``env.mock[...]`` bypasses the
#: realization seam without being declarable anywhere: it silently works in-process and
#: silently cannot work on e2e_rest, which is the same ungraded-but-unmarked outcome the
#: other four routes are locked against. Until a reach is routed through a named harness
#: method it is invisible to every existing lock, and a 45th could be added with nothing
#: going red.
#:
#: EXACT SET, NOT SHRINK-ONLY. THIS IS A DELIBERATE OVERRIDE OF THE TASK THAT FILED IT
#: (salesagent-b341x.9) AND OF THE "shrink-only ratchet" WORDING IN THE PARENT EPIC. It is
#: not a deviation to be tidied back; read this before "restoring" a ceiling.
#:
#: Three reasons, in order of weight:
#:
#: 1. A ceiling derived from the pin CAN NEVER FAIL INDEPENDENTLY — this file's own
#:    docstring says so at the top, about its other four pins, and the argument does not
#:    change for the fifth. An exact set fails in BOTH directions.
#: 2. The record settles it empirically. This population was 41 step-body reaches when the
#:    task was filed and is 37 now, because four gemini Givens in uc006 were routed through
#:    a real ``env.set_gemini_api_key()`` seam. Under a ceiling pinned at 41 those four
#:    repairs pass unnoticed AND leave four slots of headroom — a new reach could then be
#:    added with nothing going red. That is the fence-with-headroom defect arriving through
#:    the very mechanism meant to prevent it.
#: 3. A repair costing one reviewable line of pin update is a FEATURE. Routing a reach away
#:    is the direction of travel this pin exists to encourage, and it should be recorded
#:    rather than silently absorbed.
