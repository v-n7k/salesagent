"""Regression tests for fire-and-forget webhook task pinning in context_manager.

PR #1264 fix #6 pinned the fire-and-forget webhook task scheduled inside
``ContextManager._send_push_notifications`` against asyncio's weak-ref GC.
 extracted that pin to the shared ``src.core.async_utils``
helper, so the strong-ref set is now ``async_utils._pinned_tasks`` (per the
x2h.5 Dependencies note: pin_task landed first → target the shared module).

These tests drive the REAL ``_send_push_notifications`` code path (not
``pin_task`` in isolation — ``test_async_utils.py`` covers that). They prove:
  - the context_manager path actually pins the scheduled task,
  - the done-callback discards it on completion,
  - the discard runs BEFORE ``_log_task_result``'s result()-swallow even on
    the exception path (so a swallowed traceback can't keep the task alive),
  - N concurrent webhook tasks coexist as N distinct set entries.

Mutation coverage (verified during authoring):
  #1 delete pin_task(...) call            -> added-on-create FAILS
  #2 discard AFTER result() in _log_...    -> discard-before-swallow FAILS
  #3 remove add_done_callback (in pin_task)-> discarded-on-completion FAILS
  #4 set -> list for _pinned_tasks         -> concurrent-coexist FAILS
