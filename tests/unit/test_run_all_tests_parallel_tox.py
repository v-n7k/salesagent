"""The default in-network run must invoke ``tox -p``, not serial ``tox``.

The runner was serial from 2026-06-18, on an OOM rationale that a live
all-7-suites ``tox -p`` run disproved: the ``PYTEST_XDIST_AUTO_NUM_WORKERS`` /
``BDD_XDIST_N`` caps genuinely reach the in-network tests container, and memory
peaked at ~40.5% of the box -- well under the 70% fail threshold -- with zero
OOM-kills. Serial made the run's critical path the SUM of every suite rather
than the longest one.

Runs the REAL run_all_tests.sh end to end (real arg parsing, real env/suite
resolution, real command construction) rather than grepping its source, so it
asserts on genuine behavior instead of text shape. The only thing replaced is
the ``docker`` binary on PATH -- a stub that records every invocation and exits
0 -- because standing up the full Postgres/app/proxy compose stack is not
needed to observe *which command run_all_tests.sh hands to tox*, and doing so
would make this slow, non-hermetic, and dependent on a real Docker daemon.
Docker orchestration is the external boundary being stubbed, not the subject.

Also covers ``scripts/check_truncated_reports.py``, the predicate BOTH runners
apply to decide whether a green-looking run actually reported everything it
collected. Nothing graded it before: it was inline shell in one runner and
absent from the other.
