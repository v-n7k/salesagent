"""Structural guards for #1291 B2 on #1721's boundary — every operation name a
transport can serve is CLASSIFIED, and the metric label it becomes is bounded.

B2's deliverable is a classification, and a classification's failure mode is
silent. ``sanitize_operation`` collapses anything its closed vocabulary does not
admit into ``"other"`` (``src/core/metrics.py:226-240``), so a surface nobody
classified does not error — its real traffic QUIETLY LANDS IN THE BUCKET THAT
EXISTS TO ALARM ON ATTACKER-SUPPLIED NAMES. The fix is to derive the
classification from the production registry and fail ``make quality`` when
something new is unclassified.

What #1721 collapsed, and what that leaves this file
----------------------------------------------------
On the pre-merge branch there were FOUR transport-local name registries that
could disagree — the ``_register_tool(fn)`` calls in ``src/core/main.py``, the
``@router.post`` decorators in ``src/routes/api_v1.py``, ``SKILL_HANDLERS`` plus
the AgentCard's ``AgentSkill`` ids, and ``rest_compat_middleware._PATH_TO_TOOL``
— and a body-sniffing ``RegistryOperationResolver`` had to reconcile all four
per request, ABOVE authentication. Most of this file was that reconciliation.

#1721 deletes the problem rather than grading it. :data:`src.core.tools.registry.TOOLS`
is the single declaration all three transports are GENERATED from: MCP
registration loops it (``src/core/main.py:427-428``), the agent card is
``_derived_skills()`` over it and dispatch is ``TOOLS[skill_name]``
(``src/a2a_server/adcp_a2a_server.py:486-520``), and the REST router adds one
route per ``rest`` binding under ``name=<registry key>``
(``src/routes/api_v1.py``). The operation label is therefore a registry key BY
CONSTRUCTION on every transport, and the verifier runs inside
``_resolve_identity`` — after ``TOOLS[tool_name]`` resolved — rather than in a
middleware sniffing an anonymous body.

So these guards are DELETED here rather than ported, each because #1721 made the
drift it graded unrepresentable or moved it somewhere that already grades it:

* the resolver sweeps (``RegistryOperationResolver``, ``ResolvedOperation``,
  ``UNNAMED_OPERATION``) — ``src/core/signing/operations.py`` does not exist;
  the name is the registry key the boundary already resolved;
* ``TestA2ASkillListsAgree`` (R-M4) — there is no ``SKILL_HANDLERS`` to drift
  from the card, and card-versus-dispatch agreement is graded by
  ``tests/unit/test_a2a_transport_contract.py::TestAgentCardContract::test_agent_card_skills_match_dispatch``;
* ``TestRestCompatTableAgreesWithTheRouteTable`` (R-M2) —
  ``src/routes/rest_compat_middleware.py`` is deleted on #1721;
* ``TestBufferedReceiveReachesEveryArm`` (R-H2) —
  ``src/core/signing/request_verifier_middleware.py`` is deleted; nothing
  rewinds a receive channel because nothing reads the body before the boundary.

``adcp.server.mcp_tools.ADCP_TOOL_DEFINITIONS`` (63 names) stays what it always
was: the CROSS-CHECK, never the authority. Per the source hierarchy an SDK list
can diverge from the spec, so a registry row it does not name is allowlisted
with its reason rather than renamed.

What each surviving guard catches
---------------------------------
1. A new registry row the SDK does not define and nobody classified → its real
   traffic is filed under ``"other"``, indistinguishable from an attack. Fails
   here instead.
2. A hand-written ``/api/v1`` route slipping back in beside the derived ones →
   a REST surface whose name is a Python function name rather than an operation.
3. An operation name carrying a ``/`` → the JSON-RPC protocol-method shape. The
   two namespaces are matched as BARE STRINGS in one declaration
   (security.mdx @ v3.1.1 :1045-1059), so nothing but the shape keeps
   ``tasks/cancel`` out of ``required_for``.
4. A hand-listed metric vocabulary that misses a tool → that tool keeps working
   and its traffic silently demotes to ``"other"``.
5. ``sanitize_operation`` called at a CALL SITE rather than inside the recording
   helper → the second call site is the one that forgets.
