"""Executable-exemption meta-test for the test-credential-header ast-grep ban.

The ENFORCEMENT is an ast-grep rule, not this module. The rule lives at
``.ast-grep/rules/test-credential-header-single-producer.yml`` (discovered
through ``sgconfig.yml``'s ``ruleDirs``) and runs as its own ``make quality-ci``
line, the way ``ruff-egress.toml`` already does. It refuses a credential header
(``Authorization`` / ``x-adcp-auth``, any casing) assembled inline anywhere in
``tests/`` instead of through the one shared test-credential producer in
``tests/helpers/credentials.py`` — the DRY defect measured on run innet_100926_1008,
where a one-line header change cost eleven edits and 691 of 1013 failures
carried AUTH_MISSING (salesagent-2l6ii).

This module stands to that rule exactly as ``tests/unit/test_ruff_egress_bans.py``
stands to ``ruff-egress.toml``: it proves the ban FIRES and that every exemption
is live rather than prose. It deliberately does NOT re-implement the detection —
an AST scan written here would be a second, divergent copy of the rule, which is
the disease this ticket is about. Every case below shells out to the real
ast-grep with the real rule file.

Six cases:

(a) POSITIVE — every credential shape that occurs in this tree matches:
    single-pair dict, multi-key dict in BOTH key orders, the lowercase
    ``authorization`` spelling, subscript assignment, and the ``x-adcp-auth``
    alias. The multi-key orders are not padding: the naive
    ``pattern: '{"Authorization": $V}'`` matches a SINGLE-PAIR dictionary only,
    and multi-key is the common shape here because these sites also set
    ``x-adcp-tenant`` and ``x-dry-run``. Measured on the live tree, that
    literal form found 27 test-side sites where the relational rule finds 57.
(b) BUILD-FAILING — a known-bad file makes the scan exit non-zero. Without
    ``severity: error`` ast-grep prints its matches and exits 0: a rule that
    reports and passes is the dormancy this ticket exists to remove.
(c) NEGATIVE — a ``Content-Type``-only dict is not flagged, and the scan exits
    0. That exit code is also the rule file's own load proof: ast-grep exits 6,
    not 0, when ``--rule`` names a file it cannot read, so a missing or
    unparseable rule fails HERE rather than passing vacuously on empty output.
(d) PATH SCOPING — the same known-bad source under ``src/`` is NOT flagged.
    The rule's ``files: ["tests/**/*.py"]`` keeps the two legitimate PRODUCTION
    producers (``src/core/property_list_resolver.py``,
    ``src/core/security/webhook_egress.py``) out BY CONSTRUCTION. That is the
    difference between an allowlist that shrinks and one that starts with a
    third of its own matches in it.
(e) REACHABLE — the rule is found by ``--filter`` under the repo's own
    ``sgconfig.yml``, i.e. it is committed into a discovered ``ruleDirs`` entry
    and not merely readable at some path this test happens to name.
(f) LIVE TREE + CLOSED EXEMPTION SET — the rule is clean over ``tests/``, the
    set of files carrying an ``# ast-grep-ignore`` for this rule equals
    ``_RECORDED_EXEMPTIONS``, and each recorded exemption is a REAL violation
    once its suppression comment is removed. A new exemption fails until it is
    recorded here; a stale one fails because it no longer violates. ast-grep
    0.41 has no unused-suppression report, so without (f) a stale exemption is
    invisible.

Case (f) is also why this module exists at all rather than the Makefile line
alone: ``test_architecture_ratchet_enforcement.py`` already rules ``ci-step``
an insufficient enforcement point in this repo (``make quality`` is a step
"nothing requires"), so the trigger is duplicated into the suite that always
runs. ast-grep stays the only detector.

One deliberate scoping decision in the rule: a dict literal that is an operand of
a comparison is NOT flagged. An ``assert headers == {"Authorization": ...}`` is an
assertion about what a producer emitted, not a second producer, and including those
takes the population from 38 to 117 — a third of the rule's own matches would have
to be exemptions, which is growth into an allowlist rather than out of one.
