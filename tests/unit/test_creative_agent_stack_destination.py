"""Guard: every CI/test topology must hand the creative agent a destination the
armed fire-time SSRF gate accepts.

``creative_agent_registry._fetch_formats_via_raw_mcp`` dials the configured
agent through ``check_url_ssrf`` with no ``require_https`` and no testing
carve-out. Its comment states the deliberate position: the stack "puts its
compose network on a NON-private subnet ... precisely so the armed gate passes
on ``http://creative-agent:8080`` rather than needing an exemption". So the
burden is on the TOPOLOGY to offer an acceptable destination, never on the gate
to make an exception.

salesagent-2xnqw: ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` ran the ``Integration
(creative)`` group on the HOST against a loopback-published agent
(``http://localhost:9999/api/creative-agent``). ``localhost`` is in
``BLOCKED_HOSTNAMES``, so the gate refused it and all 17 dialling tests in
``tests/integration/test_creative_agent_live.py`` failed — against a file that
is byte-identical to origin/main. The fix ran that group in-network, where the
agent is reached by service name like every other dependency.

This guard grades the SHAPE of every configured destination
(``EgressPolicy.check_registration`` via the ``(bool, str)`` wrapper — scheme,
hostname blocklist, IP-literal ranges; https is unconditional since GH #1757) rather
than resolving DNS: ``creative-agent`` is a compose service name that resolves
only inside the stack, which is the whole point of running the suite there.
