"""``src/vendor/`` is excluded from every structural guard, so bound what may live there.

``src_python_files`` skips ``src/vendor/`` (see ``VENDOR_DIR`` in
``_architecture_helpers``): those guards grade authorship decisions, and copied
third-party source makes none of them. That exclusion is correct and it is also the only
place in ``src/`` where the architecture checks do not run — which makes it the obvious
place to park code that would otherwise fail one.

These tests make that impractical. A vendored package must carry its licence and say
where it came from, and the rest of the codebase may only reach it through the one seam
that owns the concept — so a module cannot quietly acquire an unchecked dependency.
