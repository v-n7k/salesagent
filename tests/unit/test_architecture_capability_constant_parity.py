"""Guard: an advertised capability value must be DERIVED from its enforced constant.

Regression guard for the idempotency replay-TTL drift: ``get_adcp_capabilities``
once advertised ``replay_ttl_seconds=86400`` as a bare literal while the *enforced*
TTL lived in ``DEFAULT_REPLAY_TTL``. A literal and a constant are two sources for one
value and drift independently — the buyer is then told a window the server does not
enforce. Every ``replay_ttl_seconds=`` site MUST reference the constant
(``int(DEFAULT_REPLAY_TTL.total_seconds())``), never a hardcoded number.

This is the AST-detectable slice of semantic single-source-of-truth. A value-counting
"duplicate literal" guard is deliberately NOT used: 86400 ("seconds per day") and 3600
("seconds per hour") have many legitimate unrelated uses in src/, so counting literals
would be almost all false positives. Keying on the capability KEYWORD instead is exact.
The non-AST-detectable slice (one invariant computed two ways) stays a review concern.
