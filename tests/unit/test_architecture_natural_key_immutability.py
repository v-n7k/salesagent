"""Guard: every column the Account natural-key lookups filter on is immutable.

salesagent-8sfr: ``AccountRepository.get_by_natural_key`` resolves a buyer's
``sync_accounts`` entry on (tenant_id, operator, brand.domain[, brand_id],
sandbox), but ``_IMMUTABLE_FIELDS`` listed only {tenant_id, account_id,
created_at}. ``operator`` and ``sandbox`` were therefore load-bearing identity
that any caller could overwrite through the generic ``update_fields(**kwargs)``
-- and the admin edit form did. The account got RE-KEYED, the buyer's next sync
carrying the original key stopped matching, and a DUPLICATE account was
provisioned for the same brand+operator.

The behavioral consequence is graded by
tests/integration/test_account_natural_key_immutability.py. This guard exists so
the CLASS cannot come back: it derives the key components from the lookup
methods' own signatures, so adding a component to a lookup without protecting it
fails here at the moment the coupling is introduced, rather than the next time
someone edits a form.

Signature-derived on purpose. A hardcoded {"operator", "sandbox"} would restate
today's answer and go stale exactly when the key changes -- which is the failure
mode being guarded against.

Scope: this guards the Account natural key specifically, not every repository.
``MediaBuyRepository.find_by_idempotency_key`` has the same shape (its
(principal_id, account_id, idempotency_key) tuple sits outside
``_MEDIA_BUY_IMMUTABLE_FIELDS``) but no caller writes those names today; that is
tracked separately rather than generalised here on one example.
