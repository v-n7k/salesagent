"""Guard: ONE field-policy table decides every ``sync_accounts`` entry field.

The Core Invariant of salesagent-gcze: every field a ``sync_accounts`` entry can
carry -- declared on the request branches OR arriving via ``extra="allow"`` -- has
exactly ONE declared disposition per entry mode, recorded in a single field-policy
table, and ALL THREE field-application sites (create, provisioning re-sync,
settings-update) are driven by that table. A field cannot then be honored on one
site and silently discarded on another.

**This guard REPLACES tests/unit/test_architecture_sync_accounts_handler_symmetry.py.**
That guard detects an applied field by AST-matching ``changes["<literal>"] = ...``.
Once application is a table walk (``changes[field] = value`` -- a non-Constant
slice) its reader returns the EMPTY SET for both branches, so
``test_settable_fields_are_applied_by_both_entry_handlers`` would pass while
proving nothing. The same change must therefore DELETE that file together with
both of its allowlists (``_KNOWN_ASYMMETRIC``, ``_KNOWN_DROPPED_BY_BOTH``): the
table IS the record, so there is no allowlist left to grow and no laundering
question about which debt a field currently sits in.

Representation-tolerant BY DESIGN. This is the TDD-red artifact written before
the table exists (salesagent-j1c0.14), so it pins the INVARIANT, not a data
structure: any module-level mapping under one of ``_ACCEPTED_TABLE_NAMES``, whose
values expose a disposition per mode either as a mapping or as attributes, and
whose dispositions are either bare strings from the closed set or objects
carrying ``kind`` + ``citation``. Pick whichever shape reads best in
``accounts.py``; only the invariant is fixed.

What it does NOT do: assert any particular field's disposition. Which disposition
each field gets is graded behaviorally in BR-UC-011 (the five
entry-field-disposition scenarios), because a table row is a claim about the wire
and only a wire scenario can hold it to that.
