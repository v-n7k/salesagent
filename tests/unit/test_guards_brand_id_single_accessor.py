"""Guard: ``brand_id`` is read out of a brand reference in exactly ONE place.

Disease (#1721): ``BrandReference.brand_id`` is ``BrandId``, a
``RootModel[str]`` that does not override ``__str__``, so ``str(brand.brand_id)``
yields the repr ``"root='brand_one'"`` instead of ``brand_one``. Five hand-rolled
copies of that extraction existed; four used bare ``str()`` and one used ``.root``.
Because ``brand_id`` is a component of the account natural key (BR-RULE-056), the
copies disagreeing meant a sync-provisioned account could never be resolved by its
own key — and since ``JSONType`` validates on read but not on write, the persisted
row could not be loaded through the ORM at all.

The fix consolidated all of them onto ``brand_key_parts``
(``src/core/helpers/brand_key.py``). This guard pins that consolidation.

**What is banned:** reading the ``.brand_id`` ATTRIBUTE anywhere in ``src/``
outside the accessor module. That covers the reintroduction of the original bug
(``str(x.brand_id)`` must first read the attribute) AND the subtler half — a NEW
correct-but-separate ``x.brand_id.root`` copy, which is how two copies come to
disagree in the first place.

**Why a name-based type guard was rejected:** ``brand_id`` is declared as a plain
``str`` on some SDK models and as ``BrandId`` on others, so no AST rule can infer
from the name alone whether a given read needs unwrapping. Pinning the single
accessor needs no type inference and is therefore sound.

**Scope boundary:** dict/SQL subscripts (``brand["brand_id"]``,
``Account.brand["brand_id"].as_string()``) are NOT flagged. A subscript yields a
plain string or a SQL column expression — neither can carry the RootModel repr, so
neither can reproduce this defect.
