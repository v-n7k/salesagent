"""Guard: a tool module that handles a buyer webhook URL routes it through a gate.

``push_notification_config.url`` and ``reporting_webhook.url`` are URLs the
protocol surface STORES now and DIALS later — by delivery time there is no
request left to refuse into, so the buyer-actionable refusal has to happen at
ingest. The salesagent-w97e disease scan found five hand-rolled copies of "pull
``url`` out of the config and store it", none of which validated; the fix routed
every protocol ingest of those fields through a validating gate.

This guard is the class-level half of that fix: a NEW tool under
``src/core/tools/`` that accepts either field and forgets the gate fails
``make quality`` here, instead of shipping the sixth unvalidated copy.

ONE gate is accepted (owner ruling "Strategy C", reconciling gh-#1697 with
gh-#1589): ``accept_push_notification_config``
(``src/core/webhooks/registration.py``) — the REGISTRATION gate, which runs
BOTH halves (URL and credential) and returns the ValidatedWebhookRegistration
value. It delegates the URL half to ``reject_unsafe_webhook_registration_url``
(``src/core/webhook_validator.py``), which stays public for ``reporting_webhook.url``
— a registration shape with no credential half — but is no longer an accepted
gate for push configs, because URL-only is exactly the half-gating this closes.
It raises
``AdCPValidationError`` → ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` / ``correctable`` with
``suggestion`` + ``field``. Decisively, it is DNS-FREE at registration: an
unresolvable but public hostname is deliberately ACCEPTED at ingest and
re-checked with DNS at send time by the egress seam, so a buyer whose DNS has
not yet propagated is not refused when registering.

The seam-helper gate is GONE. gh-#1589 briefly introduced a second gate —
``validated_push_notification_config`` / ``validated_reporting_webhook`` in
``src/core/webhook_ingest.py`` — which delegated the ingest verdict to the
outbound seam's ``validate_url``. That helper ALWAYS resolves DNS, which is
correct at SEND time and wrong at REGISTRATION time, so it refused the very
not-yet-propagated hostname Strategy C rules must be accepted. Worse, while two
gates coexisted the same buyer URL got two different answers depending on which
tool it arrived at (``update_media_buy`` refused what ``create_media_buy``
accepted). Every ingest site now uses the registration gate, the helpers have no
callers, and ``src/core/webhook_ingest.py`` is deleted; the seam remains the
SEND-time gate only. ACCEPTED_GATES is therefore single-entry — it may grow only
if a genuinely new gate is introduced, never to re-admit a DNS-resolving one.

The check is deliberately import-level — whether the module CALLS the gate on
the right value is semantic and belongs to the integration tests
(``tests/integration/test_webhook_url_ingest_refusal.py``); what is mechanical
is that a tools module which names these fields at all must at least be built
against a gate. The repository ``upsert`` is deliberately NOT the enforcement
point (it cannot know the request path, so ``error.field`` would be lost —
disposition row 19 of the scan).

Symbol-level, not module-level, on purpose: ``src.core.webhook_validator`` also
exports ``webhook_url_for_log``, a logging helper that validates nothing. A
module importing only that must NOT satisfy the guard.
