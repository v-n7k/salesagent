"""Structural guard: no module resolves webhook auth inline, outside the resolver.

The disease, stated once: *a webhook sender resolves push-notification auth
inline from the config — picking its own FIELD and its own VALUE spelling —
instead of calling one shared resolver.* A codebase-wide enumeration
(salesagent-47n9.20) found three independent senders doing it three different
ways:

* ``order_approval_service`` compares lowercase ``"bearer"`` / ``"basic"``, and
  takes its HMAC secret from ``webhook_secret`` — a column with ZERO writers in
  ``src/``, so every real HMAC row hits its refusal branch while the code
  believes the buyer supplied nothing.
* ``protocol_webhook_service`` compares spec-cased ``"Bearer"`` /
  ``"HMAC-SHA256"`` and reads ``authentication_token`` — the AdCP 3.1.1 field.
* ``webhook_delivery_service`` does a third thing again.

Three copies is not a coincidence; it is what happens when the auth decision is
a two-line ``if`` that is cheaper to retype than to look up. The fix is one
seam (``deliver_webhook``/``adeliver_webhook`` in
:mod:`src.core.security.webhook_egress`), and
this guard is what keeps copy #4 from appearing — the same role
``test_architecture_no_hardcoded_unsigned_webhook.py`` plays for the sibling
defect, whose own docstring records that the previous instance was "caught by a
disease scan, not a test failure".

Two shapes are detected, because the disease has two halves and either one
alone is enough to diverge:

**A. Comparing ``authentication_type`` against a scheme literal.** This is where
the SPELLING divergence lives (``"bearer"`` vs ``"Bearer"``). Reading the column
for logging or for a read-back response is fine; deciding from it is not.

**B. Reading ``authentication_token`` / ``webhook_secret`` off another object.**
This is where the FIELD divergence lives. Writes (``x.authentication_token =
...``, ``authentication_token=...`` keyword arguments) are untouched — the
persistence path is not the disease. ``self.<attr>`` is untouched too: an object
reading its own attribute (``WebhookVerifier.webhook_secret``, the RECEIVER-side
verifier) is not a sender picking a column off a stored config.

Scope note — the guard deliberately does NOT try to detect
``src/admin/blueprints/principals.py``'s hand-built ``PushNotificationConfig``
(disposition row 5, deferred to #2077). That site names ``auth_type=``
/ ``auth_config=``, kwargs that are not columns on the model at all; it is a
different defect (it writes nothing that any sender can read) and belongs to its
own ticket. Widening this detector to catch it would mean matching on invented
names, which no rule can state.

# The scheme spellings a sender may not compare against inline. Both cases are

# one the column holds; the resolver is where that comparison becomes
# case-insensitive, and it is the ONLY place allowed to make it.
_SCHEME_LITERALS = SCHEME_LITERAL_CASINGS

# Credential columns a sender may not read off a config object.
# NARROWED in Epic D lane C4 to ``webhook_secret`` alone.
#
# ``authentication_token`` was removed from this set deliberately, and the reason
# is that the rule it served became unsatisfiable rather than unimportant. While a
# resolver existed, a sender touching that column was about to DECIDE something,
# so banning the read was a good proxy. Senders now pass the stored
# ``(scheme, credentials)`` pair to the egress seam and branch on the returned
# outcome — they must read the column to hand it over, so flagging the read would
# forbid the very shape this epic installed.
#
# What the guard still catches is unchanged and is the real disease: comparing
# ``authentication_type`` against a scheme literal (a sender answering "is this
# HMAC?" itself), and reading ``webhook_secret`` — a column with ZERO writers in
# src/, so any read of it is reaching for a credential nothing populates
# (GH #1894 defect 1).
_CREDENTIAL_ATTRS = frozenset({"webhook_secret"})

# The resolver's own module — "outside the resolver" is the rule, so the
# resolver is not scanned. Not an allowlist entry: an allowlist records debt,
# and this records the one legitimate home for the logic.

# NO exemption for arguments forwarded to the seam.
#
# There used to be one: a sender migrating onto the resolver necessarily wrote
# ``resolver(config.authentication_type, config.authentication_token)``, and that
# read was the fix rather than the disease. Epic D lane C4 narrowed
# ``_CREDENTIAL_ATTRS`` to ``webhook_secret`` alone and thereby removed the
# exemption's reason to exist; it survived the narrowing as residue.
#
# Measured before deleting it: its ONLY reachable effect was to whitelist a read
# of ``webhook_secret`` -- the column this module's own docstring calls one with
# ZERO writers in src/, so any read of it reaches for a credential nothing
# populates -- plus a scheme-literal comparison written inline as a seam
# argument, which is a hole in the primary rule too. Keeping it would have meant
# certifying both holes as intended.

# Files permitted to still contain the disease, by path. Shrink-only.
#
# Two kinds of entry, and they are documented differently at the source:
#
# * DEBT — the disease is really there and someone will remove it. Needs a
#   ``# FIXME(#<gh-issue>)`` comment at the source location (a GitHub issue, never
#   a beads id, so an outside contributor can resolve it). Closing the issue
#   removes the entry.
# * JUSTIFIED FALSE POSITIVE — the detector matches but the semantic is different,
#   and there is nothing to fix. A FIXME would be a lie about future work; the
#   reason lives in the comment here and beside the code.
#
# This guard grades the file SET; the source comments tell the next reader which
# kind each one is.
# NOTE: `set()`, not `{}` — a brace literal containing only comments is an
# empty DICT, which the allowlist helper cannot subtract.
# ``src/services/webhook_delivery_service.py`` was here until
# #1894 converged it on the resolver. Do not re-add
# it, or anything else: the only remaining entry below is a justified false
# positive, so a NEW debt entry would mean a sender started resolving auth
# inline again -- which is the whole disease.
#
# The a2a_server entry (a read-BACK of authentication_token, echoing the
# buyer's own registration to them) was REMOVED in Epic D lane C4: with the
# set narrowed to webhook_secret, that read is no longer flagged at all, so the
# entry became stale. The allowlist is now EMPTY and must stay that way.
