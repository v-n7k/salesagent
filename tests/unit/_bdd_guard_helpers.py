"""Shared helpers for BDD structural guard tests.

Extracts common AST scanning patterns used by multiple guard test files
to avoid code duplication (DRY invariant).

Every BDD guard that needs to walk ``tests/bdd/steps/`` and pick out
``@given`` / ``@when`` / ``@then`` functions goes through :func:`iter_bdd_steps`.
Guards keep their OWN detector (what counts as a violation); only the
find-the-step-functions machinery is shared.
