"""Floors under the measurement counters that can silently measure nothing.

Plan Decision 5 (#1858): "Each measurement stage degrades to 'measured less'
without failing. Every counter gets a minimum that fails the run when
measurement disappears."

Two floors live here. Both guard a counter whose failure mode is SILENCE — the
thing being counted disappears and the count keeps reporting success.

# Deleting one row turns its scenarios dormant and every structural guard stays
# green, because the guards check the registry's SHAPE, not its MEMBERSHIP.

# Pinned as a SET, not a count: a count is satisfied by add-plus-drop, which is
# the same weakness this epic's suite comparisons avoid by comparing xpassed
# node ids by identity rather than by size.
#
# The set spans BOTH sources, deliberately. The literal `ENV_ROUTES` block holds
# 20 wired rows; `ENV_ROUTES +=` appends 5 more from `_UC_BUCKET_ROUTES` at
# import time. "How many wired rows are there" therefore has two answers (20 and
# 25), and a floor that does not say which it means is itself an ambiguous
# counter. This pins the runtime set — what actually routes scenarios.
#
# Discipline, matching EXPECTED_LEDGER in test_storyboard_ledger_state.py:
# graduating a placeholder to wired ADDS a tag here in the same change, as a
# reviewed edit. A tag disappearing without one is the regression this catches.
