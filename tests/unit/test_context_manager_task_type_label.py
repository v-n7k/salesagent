"""Regression tests: task_type wire-fallback must not leak into the internal label.

 (latent bug). ``ContextManager._send_push_notifications`` builds
the SDK webhook payload via ``create_mcp_webhook_payload``, which validates
``task_type`` against the closed ``adcp.types.TaskType`` enum and coerces
non-members to a fallback (``update_media_buy``). The pre-fix code rewrote the
single ``task_type_str`` variable in place, so the coerced wire value leaked
into the typed context's ``task_type`` — the label consumed by
``protocol_webhook_service`` for the audit log, the delivery-webhook guards,
and the ``WebhookDeliveryLog.task_type`` DB column.

The fix keeps two distinct values:
  - the typed context's ``task_type`` = the ORIGINAL action label (untouched), and
  - the SDK payload's ``task_type`` = a validated COPY (coerced when invalid).

Mutation coverage (verified during authoring):
  #1 task.task_type = wire_task_type (reuse coerced copy)
     -> test_task_context_keeps_original_label_for_non_tasktype FAILS
  #2 pass task_type_str (uncoerced) to create_mcp_webhook_payload
     -> the builder raises on the invalid enum value; _drive surfaces no
        send_notification call -> test_*_for_non_tasktype FAILS
