"""Unit tests for resolve_supported_billing and the sync_accounts billing gate.

Pins the #1521 / #1592 billing-policy contract (BR-RULE-059):

- ``resolve_supported_billing(tenant)`` is the single resolution point for BOTH
  the sync_accounts gate and the capabilities ``account.supported_billing``
  emission. Unconfigured (None/missing) → the full spec enum (owner decision,
  2026-07-14); configured → exactly as configured; ``[]`` → reject-everything
  (empty is a real policy, NOT "unconfigured" — no falsy collapse).
- ``_check_billing_policy`` governs UNSUPPORTED billing, never OMITTED billing:
  ``SyncAccountsAccount.billing`` is Optional on the create path, and BR-RULE-059
  does not authorize rejecting an omitted optional field. An omitted billing
  (billing_val=None) must pass the gate under both unconfigured and configured
  tenants.
