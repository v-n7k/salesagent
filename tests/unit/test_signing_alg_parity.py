"""Guard: the signing-algorithm value-set has exactly ONE source of truth, ORDERED.

Written TDD RED for salesagent-z6nr.8 (A2 — signing key lifecycle); green since
``src/core/signing/algorithms.py`` and the ``SigningKey`` ORM model landed. That
leaf is the layer's only home for these value-sets — there is no second package
and no forwarding shim that a guard could check instead.

Shaped after ``tests/unit/test_billing_party_parity.py``, which pins the same
disease: a DB CHECK hand-written as a literal copy of a spec enum drifts, and a
spec-valid value then IntegrityError's on INSERT (#1521).

Ordering is load-bearing HERE in a way it is not for billing.
``src.core.billing_policy.BILLING_PARTY_VALUES`` derives from an ORDERED enum,
but ``adcp.signing.crypto.ALLOWED_ALGS`` is a ``frozenset[str]`` — iterating it
yields hash order, and CPython randomizes str hashes per process. Deriving the
CHECK body straight off the frozenset emits DIFFERENT DDL text on different
runs: the ORM DDL and the migration DDL can disagree and alembic autogenerate
churns. ``SIGNING_ALG_VALUES`` must therefore be ``tuple(sorted(ALLOWED_ALGS))``
— a deterministic order that lands in the DDL — which is why guard (a) pins the
exact tuple and not merely its contents.
