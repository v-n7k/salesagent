"""Repro: GAM creative-asset validation must reject as CREATIVE_REJECTED, not ValueError.

The GAM creatives manager raises bare ``ValueError`` for buyer-correctable
creative-input problems (non-URL image asset, missing video duration). These
are creative-input rejections: the pinned spec (AdCP v3.1.1
dist/schemas/3.1.1/enums/error-code.json) classifies ``CREATIVE_REJECTED`` as
``correctable`` ("revise the creative per the seller's advertising_policies"),
graded on the creative surface (compliance/3.1.1 creative scenarios,
``task: sync_creatives``) — NOT the generic-adapter SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE /
transient family a bare ValueError decays into (salesagent-z06g).

On the reaching surfaces (the three create-media-buy push paths),
``add_creative_assets`` reports per-asset partial success; its blanket
``except`` swallowed the reason entirely, so the buyer saw a bare
``status="failed"`` with ``message=None`` and nothing actionable. The typed
error must carry its message into the ``AssetStatus``.
