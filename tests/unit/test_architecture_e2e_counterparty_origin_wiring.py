"""Structural guard: the e2e COUNTERPARTY origin and the server's CA trust are wired.

salesagent-mp53.8 builds the accepted leg of the inbound RFC 9421 verifier: a
request signed by a counterparty whose key the server resolves BY WALKING that
counterparty's published trust root is accepted, over real HTTP. The walk is
three outbound hops made by the SERVER container —
``agent_url -> capabilities -> identity.brand_json_url -> brand.json agents[] ->
jwks_uri -> JWKS`` (``adcp.signing.agent_resolver``) — so the leg only exists if
the stack gives the server something real to walk, and a trust store that
accepts the leaf it will be handed.

Sibling of ``test_architecture_e2e_webhook_capture_wiring.py`` (mp53.9) and it
shares that module's four detectors, which now live in
``tests/unit/_architecture_helpers.py``. Same reasoning for existing at all: the
behaviour is graded in-network by
``tests/e2e/test_request_signature_accepted_e2e.py``, but a half-wired stack
fails at ``docker compose up`` or, far worse, comes up and produces a 401 whose
message names an unresolvable counterparty rather than the missing compose line.
This guard reads the REAL files at ``make quality`` time.

The five sites:

1. a ``counterparty-origin`` compose service running the static origin module —
   a SIBLING of the capture service, never a mode flag inside it. What would be
   reused there is ~30 lines of ``BaseHTTPRequestHandler``; what would be
   coupled is a handler whose other mode records raw bytes for the signing
   suite.
2. the compose network alias on the EXISTING ``tls-proxy`` service, so the
   counterparty is a real HTTPS origin behind the one terminator.
3. the nginx SNI map row, routing that hostname to that service — the upstream
   half checked too, because a hostname routed to the WRONG service is wired
   everywhere a guard would look and still reaches the wrong origin.
4. leaf-certificate coverage for the hostname. ``counterparty.adcp-e2e.dev`` sits
   under the EXISTING ``*.adcp.test`` wildcard, so this one passes today and is
   here as a regression guard: a future narrowing of ``SAN_DNS_NAMES`` would
   otherwise break the walk at certificate verification, which surfaces as
   ``capabilities_unreachable``.
5. ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` on ``adcp-server``, pointing at a CONCATENATED bundle.
   ``adcp.signing.ip_pinned_transport._build_ssl_context`` is a bare
   ``ssl.create_default_context()``; the ``trust_env=False`` on the SDK's httpx
   clients is an httpx-level flag and cannot reach it, because OpenSSL reads
   ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` itself via ``set_default_verify_paths()``. Without it the
   server's handshake to the counterparty's ``https://...:8443`` leaf (signed by
   the private stack CA) fails and the walk dies silently as a key it could not
   resolve.

**Not a relaxation, and the guard is written so it cannot become one.**
Certificate validation stays full-strength against a real CA — this is the
receiver-side twin of the runner's ``E2E_CA_BUNDLE`` and the tls-proxy
healthcheck's ``--cacert``. What the guard pins is the CONCATENATION: ``SSL_CERT_FILE``
REPLACES the file half of the trust store rather than adding to it, so pointing
it at ``ca.pem`` alone would drop the public roots from that half. (The often-repeated
justification "otherwise every other outbound TLS fails" is image-dependent —
``set_default_verify_paths()`` honours ``SSL_CERT_DIR`` independently, and the
Debian-based server image has a populated hashed ``/etc/ssl/certs``. The bundle is
right under every image, which is why it is required here rather than argued for.)

#: The counterparty's hostname, under the ``*.adcp-e2e.dev`` wildcard SAN.

#: ``.test`` was tried first and is WRONG here, for a reason distinct from the one
#: that ruled it out on the webhook path. The SSRF argument does hold — the
#: inbound walk is gated by ``resolve_and_validate_host``, which applies IP
#: arithmetic only, and ``src/core/signing/`` never calls
#: ``is_reserved_tld_host``. But TIER 3 is a second gate that argument misses:
#: brand authorization matches the agent url against the brand domain by
#: eTLD+1 (``adcp.signing.etld.registrable_domain``), and ``.test`` is not in the
#: public suffix list, so ``registrable_domain("counterparty.adcp.test")`` is
#: ``None`` and the check refuses with ``brand_domain_invalid``. Measured
