"""Guard: no dark per-tenant signing primitive.

**The disease** (verbatim from the salesagent-7x8t codebase scan): *a per-tenant
capability or credential primitive that exists in ``src/`` but is reached ONLY from
tests — no production caller (admin route, CLI script, bootstrap, migration, service)
ever invokes it, so the feature is dark in production.*

That is what salesagent-7x8t was: ``provision_signing_key``, ``SigningKeyUoW``,
``create_from_keypair``, ``revoke``, ``active_at`` and
``clear_signing_provider_cache`` all existed, were all graded end-to-end by the test
suite, and none of them had a single production caller. Every tenant's
``/.well-known/jwks.json`` answered ``{"keys": []}`` while the suite was green.

The detector is two-sided, because the disease is defined by ABSENCE and a single
grep can only show presence:

1. the symbol is referenced from ``tests/``  — someone believes it works; and
2. the symbol is referenced from no LIVE module under ``src/`` or ``scripts/``.

Re-exports through ``__init__.py`` are not callers — that is precisely how
``SigningKeyUoW`` looked reachable while having zero consumers.

Two detector-correctness rules, each of which a naive version gets wrong:

* **Load context only.** ``obj.attr = x`` binds ``attr``; it does not CALL it, so a
  Store-context attribute must never count as a production caller. (Same for
  ``obj.attr: T``.) Graded by ``test_store_context_is_not_a_production_caller``.
* **Liveness is transitive.** A reference from a module that is itself dark rescues
  nothing — pre-fix, ``create_from_keypair``'s only referrer was ``keys.py``, which
  was dark itself. Scope modules are therefore resolved to a fixpoint: a scope module
  counts as a caller only once something already live reaches it. Graded by
  ``test_a_dark_module_does_not_rescue_the_symbols_it_calls``.

## Scope — and why it is not broader

Covered: the per-tenant SIGNING-KEY CREDENTIAL surface — mint, store, resolve,
select, publish, and the unit-of-work layer that owns them.

    src/core/signing/keys.py                        mint + store
    src/core/signing/provider.py                    resolve + provider cache
    src/core/signing/posture.py                     key-presence derivation
    src/core/signing/algorithms.py                  value sets + kid minting
    src/core/signing/trust_root.py                  publication documents
    src/core/database/repositories/signing_key.py   row read/write/selectors
    src/core/database/repositories/uow.py           the owning UoW layer

Deliberately NOT whole-tree, and not even whole-``src/core/signing/``. A whole-tree
version needs a large allowlist for framework entry points, adapter interface
methods and abstract bases, and a guard with a 200-entry allowlist protects nothing.
Specifically excluded, with reasons:

* ``canonical.py``, ``vocabulary.py``, ``capture.py``, ``verifier.py``,
  ``replay_store.py``, ``revocation.py`` — the inbound-VERIFIER surface. These handle
  the COUNTERPARTY's keys, not a per-tenant credential of ours, and their entry points
  dispatch from OUTSIDE this tree: ``verifier.py`` is called by ``_resolve_identity``
  behind the tool boundary (on #1721 there is no verifier middleware at all), and the
  rest are wired into the ``adcp`` SDK's ``ReplayStore`` / resolver Protocols.
  ``PostgresReplayStore.remember`` and ``.at_capacity`` are called by ``adcp.signing``
  and by nothing in ``src/``, so the two-sided test structurally cannot decide them.
* ``src/core/agent_identity.py`` — its ``brand_json_url`` / ``jwks_origin`` are no
  longer dark: ``src/core/tools/capabilities.py`` emits both as
  ``identity.brand_json_url`` / ``identity.key_origins``, and
  ``src/routes/well_known.py`` serves what they point at. The module stays out of scope
  for the OTHER reason, which does not expire — including it would import a
  name-collision false negative: ``src/core/signing/revocation.py`` reads
  ``resolution.brand_json_url`` off an unrelated dataclass (the COUNTERPARTY's resolved
  identity), and a name-based detector cannot tell the two apart.

Known limitation, stated rather than hidden: matching is by NAME, so a same-named
attribute on an unrelated object reads as a caller. Inside this scope no such
collision exists today; that is part of why the scope is drawn here.

## Allowlist policy

Shrink-only, and it must stay near zero — a growing allowlist here means dark
primitives are accumulating again, which is the whole failure this guard exists to
stop. Every entry carries a GitHub issue number at the source location.

# EMPTY, and it ships that way (#1757 B2). It briefly carried
# ("src/core/signing/provider.py", "resolve_signing_provider") with a FIXME — but BOTH
# the guard and the symbol are introduced by this PR, so that was an allowlist larger
# than it started, and this guard's own fix hint forbids exactly that resolution: "Do NOT
# add an allowlist entry to make this pass."
#
# The entry's argument was half right. resolve_signing_provider is NOT dead code: it and
# resolve_signing_material are one-line projections of the same _resolve_cached call, and
# ~10 integration tests grade that shared path THROUGH the provider form — including
# provider.sign() and provider.key_id(), i.e. production's binding of resolved material
# into an InMemorySigningProvider. Deleting it would make those tests construct that
# themselves and grade a test-side copy.
#
# But the conclusion was wrong, and so was "delete it". The symbol is NOT on the layer's
# facade — src/core/signing/__init__.py neither imports nor exports it — and that module's
# docstring says everything below the package is private to the layer. So it was already
# private BY THE LAYER'S OWN RULE and merely unmarked. It is now _resolve_signing_provider,
# which this guard does not scan (see test_private_symbols_are_not_scanned), the
# declaration matches the facade's contract, and no graded behaviour was removed.
