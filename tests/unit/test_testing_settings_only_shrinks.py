"""``TestingSettings`` is a work list, and it may only get shorter.

Every field on that class says A SUITE IS RUNNING. A production path that consults one
serves a different seller under test than in deployment, so the suite's verdict becomes
conditional on the suite being what ran it — CLAUDE.md pattern 11. The class therefore has
no legitimate growth: a new field is a new instance of the defect.

This pins the exact field set. Removing a field passes once you also delete it here, in the
same change, which is the discipline the repo's other shrink-only pins carry. ADDING one
fails, and the message says what to do instead.

Not a duplicate of ``test_test_flag_properties_only_shrink.py``: that pins the seven
``Settings`` PROPERTIES that still fork on ``adcp_testing`` (GH #2255). This pins the
FIELDS that exist to be forked on. The properties are the readers; these are the switches.

``ProvisioningSettings`` is deliberately not covered. Its three fields — seed a demo
tenant, seed sample data, skip migrations — are facts an operator asks of a fresh
deployment, read once at init, and none of them asks whether a suite is running. They lived
on ``TestingSettings`` and that was the confusion worth removing: a class name implying
everything inside is a test artifact hides which fields are actually defects.
