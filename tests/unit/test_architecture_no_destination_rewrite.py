"""Guard: no code under src/ rebuilds a URL or rewrites its destination fields.

Routing every request through the egress seam
(``src/core/security/outbound_http.py``) is not enough if code in front of the
seam may still change WHERE the request goes. A host rewrite ahead of ``asend``
means the URL the seam validates and pins is not the URL the caller supplied —
the latent SSRF shape the #1589 follow-up removed
(``_normalize_localhost_for_docker`` in ``protocol_webhook_service.py`` rewrote
``localhost`` to ``host.docker.internal`` before delivery, failing open on
parse errors).

The scan flags URL reconstruction anywhere under ``src/``: ``urlunparse(...)``
/ ``urlunsplit(...)`` calls and ``._replace(netloc=...)`` /
``._replace(scheme=...)`` (#1589). Nothing is exempt — not even the seam:
address policy there is delegated to ``adcp.signing``, which pins the resolved
IP without ever rewriting the URL, so a netloc rewrite inside the seam would be
just as wrong. The scan set is empty and there is no allowlist to grow.

Scope, stated precisely: this detector matches the stdlib REASSEMBLY spellings.
It deliberately does not try to catch every way a destination can change hands
— ``src/core/creative_agent_registry.py``'s ``_connection_agent_url`` swaps the
transport URL for the env-configured ``CREATIVE_AGENT_URL`` alias by returning
a different STRING (sanctioned, salesagent-9qe2), which no spelling scan can
distinguish from hostile code statically. That swap's bounds are graded
behaviourally instead: ``tests/unit/test_creative_agent_connection_alias.py``
asserts it applies only to the public default agent, only when the env var is
set, and that identity/cache-key URLs stay byte-identical.

Sibling guards for the other egress properties: the raw-lib and SDK-client
import bans formerly in ``test_architecture_no_raw_egress.py`` now live in
``ruff-egress.toml`` (TID251, run over ``src/`` by ``make quality-ci``), with
``tests/unit/test_ruff_egress_bans.py`` as their executable non-vacuity proof;
the seam's own construction is graded by
``tests/integration/test_mcp_client_egress.py`` over a real socket.
