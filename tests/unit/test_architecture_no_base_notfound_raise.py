"""Guard: raise a typed AdCPNotFoundError subclass, never the base class.

The base ``AdCPNotFoundError`` emits ``REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND`` with
recovery=correctable -- it is the pin's fallback for a resource type with no
dedicated code. What it does NOT carry is a typed identity: it cannot say WHICH
resource was missing. Entity-specific subclasses can:

    AdCPMediaBuyNotFoundError, AdCPPackageNotFoundError, AdCPProductNotFoundError,
    AdCPAccountNotFoundError, AdCPContextNotFoundError, AdCPCreativeNotFoundError,
    AdCPFormatNotFoundError, AdCPTaskNotFoundError

Raising the BASE class in business logic loses that identity. This guard forbids ``raise AdCPNotFoundError(...)`` anywhere
in ``src/`` — use (or create) a specific subclass.

Only a fresh ``raise`` of the base is flagged. Catching it in an ``except``
clause (e.g. ``except AdCPNotFoundError``) is fine and intentionally allowed —
the base is the right thing to catch, just not to raise.

Allowlist is empty: every not-found raise across src/ uses a typed subclass.
(The former lone entry, ``account_helpers.resolve_account``'s unsupported-variant
fall-through, was retyped to ``ValueError`` — it is an unreachable internal
contract violation, not a buyer-facing not-found.)
