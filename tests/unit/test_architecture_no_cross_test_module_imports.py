"""Guard: a ``test_*.py`` module must not import from a sibling ``test_*.py`` module.

The disease: a shared helper lives in a module whose JOB is to be a test, so an
unrelated suite imports it. The exporter is then pinned by a consumer nobody
reading it can see — renaming it, splitting it, or moving a class out of it
silently breaks a different suite, and the breakage surfaces as a collection
error in a file the author never touched. Helpers that are meant to be imported
already have homes: ``tests/helpers/**``, ``tests/factories/**``,
``tests/bdd/steps/**``, ``conftest.py``, and suite-local ``_*_helpers.py`` /
``tests/unit/_architecture_helpers.py``. Imports from those are NOT the disease
and are not scanned — only a ``test_*`` EXPORTER counts.

Detection is import-graph/AST based, not regex: the four shapes below are all
graded off ``ast.Import`` / ``ast.ImportFrom`` nodes, so an import nested inside
a function body, or written as ``from tests.unit import test_foo``, is caught
identically to a module-level ``from tests.unit.test_foo import bar``. Because
nothing here is regex-based there is no near-miss/"would-be-missed" variant to
pin — ``test_ast_catches_forms_a_line_anchored_regex_would_miss`` shows the
shapes a line-anchored grep of the same rule drops and this detector does not.

**Baseline provenance.** The guard arrived with the request-signing work, where
the whole tree held three instances. It is measured here against the MERGED
tree, whose test corpus is the union of that branch and the request-boundary
rework, so the baseline was remeasured rather than carried over. Nothing was
added to hide a new violation: every row below is an import that already existed
on one of the two merged sides.

**Why the allowlisted rows are not new violations.** The allowlist below may only
ever SHRINK, and its rows are not one kind of thing:

* ``test_architecture_ci_suite_coverage.py`` -> ``tests.smoke.test_smoke_basic``
  is genuinely NOT the disease and is expected to stay forever. That guard's
  SUBJECT UNDER TEST is the smoke suite's no-skipped-tests test class; importing
  it is how the guard reaches the thing it grades. Moving ``TestNoSkippedTests``
  into a helper to satisfy a blanket rule would defeat the guard it feeds.
* Every other row IS the disease, in a domain unrelated to the change that
  introduced this guard, and is deferred rather than fixed inside an unrelated
  PR. Rows are grouped by EXPORTER, because the fix is per-exporter and repairs
  every importer under it at once: move the shared symbol into
  ``tests/unit/_architecture_helpers.py`` (guard helpers), a suite-local
  ``_*_helpers.py``, or ``tests/helpers/**``, then repoint each importer listed.
  There is no GitHub issue for them yet, so no ``# FIXME(#<gh>)`` marker is
  written — the project convention is that code comments cite GitHub issue
  numbers and never local tracker ids, and inventing an id that resolves for
  nobody is worse than naming the work here.

Reproducible scan (what this guard automates):

    grep -rn "^\\s*from tests\\.[a-z_.]*\\.test_[a-z0-9_]* import" tests/ --include="*.py"
