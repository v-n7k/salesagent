"""Structural guard: every SNI-routed origin is actually STARTED by the runner.

An origin service can be wired perfectly — compose service, network alias, nginx
``$ssl_server_name`` route, certificate SAN — and still be absent at runtime,
because ``run_all_tests.sh`` brings services up by an EXPLICIT list. A service
missing from that list is not a compose error and not a startup error: nginx
resolves the SNI route, finds nothing listening, and answers **502**. That 502
surfaces wherever the test happens to touch it, which for a signing walk is
three hops downstream — as an unresolvable key, a ``capabilities_unreachable``,
or a signature that "failed to verify".

This is not hypothetical. salesagent-mp53.9 added the ``webhook-capture`` service
and did not add it here; nothing in-network dialled it (its egress test grades
DNS and gate arithmetic, its contract test runs the service in-process), so the
omission stayed invisible. salesagent-mp53.8's counterparty walk was the first leg
to actually need an origin up, and it failed on exactly that 502 — after a full
20-minute suite, with a message about the JWKS install rather than about a
service that was never started.

The pairing this guard pins is narrow and mechanical: if the TLS front routes a
hostname to ``<service>:<port>`` by SNI, then ``<service>`` is an origin the
server can dial, and the runner must start it.
