"""Guard: a broad ``except`` must not relabel arbitrary failures as a *ValidationError.

Banned shape::

    except Exception as e:              # or bare `except:` / `except BaseException:`
        raise SomeValidationError(...)  # any name ending in "ValidationError"

A ``*ValidationError`` tells the caller **"your input violates the contract."**
A broad ``except`` catches implementation bugs — ``AttributeError``,
``TypeError``, a typo in an f-string — and this shape reports every one of them
as the caller's fault. The reader then hunts a contract violation that does not
exist, which is exactly the confusion #1843 was opened to eliminate.

The fix is never "log it too". It is to name the failure types that genuinely
mean the operation could not be performed, and let everything else propagate to
whatever handles internal errors at the boundary. #1868 did this for
``tests/helpers/adcp_schema_validator.py``: it now maps a fixed
``_INSTRUMENT_FAILURES`` tuple to ``SchemaError`` and has no ``except Exception``
branch at all.

NOT violations, deliberately:

- ``except Exception: raise ValueError(...)`` — ``ValueError`` is an internal
  Python signal, not a buyer-facing contract verdict.
- ``except Exception: raise AdCPAdapterError(...)`` (and
  ``AdCPServiceUnavailableError``, ...) — these types
  already mean "something outside this code broke", which is the honest reading
  of an unexpected exception. Broad catch, correct label.
- ``except (SchemaError, KeyError): raise SomeValidationError(...)`` — a NAMED
  tuple is the fix, not the disease.

Sibling guard: ``test_architecture_no_silent_except.py`` bans the *swallow*
half (``except Exception: pass``) in ``src/``. This one bans the *mislabel*
half, tree-wide.
