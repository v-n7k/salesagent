"""Guard: per-item failures in _impl loops must be surfaced, not swallowed.

CLAUDE.md rule: "No Quiet Failures". When an ``_impl`` function iterates to
build a response and an item's processing fails, the failure must be visible
to the caller — a raised ``AdCPSalesAgentError``, an advisory appended to the response's
``errors[]`` list, or at minimum a recorded per-item result. A handler that
only logs (or logs and ``continue``s) makes the item silently vanish from the
response: the buyer sees a shorter list with no signal that anything failed.

Origin: PR #1545 review — ``_get_media_buy_delivery_impl`` had two sibling
handlers on the same loop path; the inner adapter handler appended a
``SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`` advisory while the outer handler only logged and fell
through, so a failure in the status/model path dropped the buy with no signal.

TWO RULES live here, and they PARTITION the handler space by position — the loop
rule requires ``in_loop``, the straight-line rule forbids it, so no handler is
reported twice and neither allowlist can quietly cover the other's ground:

1. ``find_silent_loop_handlers`` — per-item failures in a ``for``/``while`` loop
   (described below). Allowlist: ``SILENT_LOOP_HANDLER_ALLOWLIST``.
2. ``find_silent_advisory_handlers`` — STRAIGHT-LINE degradations that drop
   content from the response as a whole. In scope when the ``_impl`` builds an
   advisory container OR its return annotation names a response type carrying
   ``errors[]`` (deliberately shallow — see ``_returns_response_with_errors``).
   Allowlist: ``SILENT_ADVISORY_HANDLER_ALLOWLIST``, plus source-level
   ``# structural-guard:`` resolutions applied in ``_scan_all_advisory``.

Neither rule sees a handler NESTED inside another handler: best-effort cleanup
on a failure path (an audit-log write inside a SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE handler) is
exempt by design. That is why the partition is "at most one rule", not "exactly
one" — see ``TestSilentHandlerRulePartition``.

Both allowlists are keyed (file, function, ORDINAL-within-function), not
(file, function): a coarser key let a second violation hide behind an existing
entry, and a line-based key went stale on any edit above the handler.

Detection for rule 1 (AST): inside functions named ``*_impl`` under
``src/core/tools/``, an ``except`` handler that sits directly in a
``for``/``while`` loop (not nested inside another handler) is a violation when
it:

- contains no ``raise``, AND
- calls no ``.append(...)`` / ``.extend(...)`` / ``.add(...)``, AND
- contains ``continue`` (item explicitly skipped), OR consists solely of
  expression/``pass`` statements (log-only fall-through), OR LOGS while assigning
  a fallback.

Handlers that SILENTLY assign a fallback value and let the iteration proceed are
fine — the item still reaches the response and nothing claims otherwise. Adding a
log line to such a handler is the handler admitting the value it substituted is
not the real one, and that admission must reach the buyer too: see
``_handler_is_silent``.

Allowlist can only SHRINK. Every entry has a FIXME(#gh-issue) at the source.

def _handler_is_silent(handler: ast.ExceptHandler) -> bool:
    """True when the handler swallows the failure without surfacing it.

    Three swallowing shapes, all equivalent from the buyer's seat:

    - ``continue`` — the item is explicitly skipped;
    - log-only fall-through — the body is nothing but expression/``pass``;
    - ASSIGN-A-FALLBACK-**AND**-LOG — the item reaches the response, but carrying a
      value the seller never asserted, and the log line is the handler ADMITTING
      that. This is the rule ``_handler_is_exempt_shape``'s docstring already
      states for the straight-line detector — "A handler that LOGS is admitting
      something went wrong and must still surface it; only the silent, deliberate
      default is exempt" — applied here. A SILENT fallback assignment stays exempt
      (the ``creative_formats`` event-loop retry and cursor reset), so this rule
      adds no violations today; what it PINS is that a site which chose to log
      cannot later drop its ``errors[]`` advisory and keep only the log.

    KNOWN OVER-APPROXIMATION: a handler is treated as *surfacing* if it raises OR
    calls any ``.append``/``.extend``/``.add`` — regardless of the target. A
    handler that appends to an unrelated scratch buffer (``log; scratch.append(x);
    continue``) is therefore a FALSE NEGATIVE this guard will not catch: proving,
    via AST alone, that the append target is the response's ``errors[]`` list
    would require whole-function dataflow the guard deliberately avoids. So an
    empty allowlist means "no handler that both loops-and-continues AND does
    nothing list-like was found" — NOT "every dropped item is provably surfaced."
    The append-to-``errors[]`` convention is the enforceable proxy; genuine
    surfacing is still a human-review responsibility.

# The detector above only sees handlers INSIDE a for/while loop, and it exempts
# "handlers that assign a fallback value and let iteration proceed". Both
# exclusions are right for the per-item case, and both make it structurally blind
# to the OTHER shape of the same disease: a straight-line `try/except` around a
# whole lookup that logs, falls through to a placeholder, and returns a silently
# degraded response.
#
# That is what `_get_adcp_capabilities_impl` did at five sites before B5 — the
# buyer could not tell "this seller has none" from "the lookup failed".
#
# Keyed STRUCTURALLY, not by function name: an `*_impl` that builds an advisory
# list and passes it to a response `errors=` argument has opted into surfacing
# degradations, so every straight-line handler in it must append to that list. A
# rule keyed to the literal name `_get_adcp_capabilities_impl` would die silently
# on a rename or a helper extraction — which the B5 "extract ONE helper" step
# makes likely. Keying on the advisory list means the guard follows the pattern,
# not the identifier.
#
# Deliberately NARROW: functions with no advisory list are not in scope, so
# products.py (which degrades but builds no advisory list) stays invisible here.
# Widening the detector to those is the scope widening below, which surfaces that
# group all at once.
#
# "Advisory list" means a CONTAINER this function holds and a handler can reach —
# see `_advisory_list_names`. `_create_media_buy_impl` derives its advisories from
# the request (`errors=property_list_unsupported_advisories(req.packages, adapter)`)
# and holds no container, so it is out of scope and no longer allowlisted. Its
# best-effort Slack / activity-feed / audit-log handlers were never this guard's
# business; the per-item row in SILENT_LOOP_HANDLER_ALLOWLIST above still covers
# the one loop-shaped swallow it does have.

    (``errors=normalize_advisory_errors(advisories) or None``), since the
    normalizer is the sanctioned wrapper around the container.

    Two filters keep this to the CONTAINER rather than every name in the

    read ``errors=property_list_unsupported_advisories(req.packages, adapter)`` in
    ``_create_media_buy_impl`` as three advisory lists — ``req``, ``adapter`` and
    the callee. That function computes its advisories from the REQUEST and holds
    no container at all, so the guard's own fix hint ("append to that list") was
    impossible to follow there; worse, treating ``req``/``adapter`` as advisory
    names made every handler that merely passes one of them to a call score as
    "surfacing" — a false NEGATIVE. So:

    - a name must be *bound in this function* and not a parameter, and
    - a name reached only as a call argument counts only in the wrapper position
      (first positional arg of the call producing the value); a helper that
      DERIVES advisories from other inputs contributes no container.

    Strictly narrower than harvesting every name, so it can only remove functions

#
# The widened predicate is: in scope if the function builds an advisory container
# OR its RETURN ANNOTATION names a response type carrying `errors[]`. It must stay
# SHALLOW. `_create_media_buy_impl` returns `CreateMediaBuyResult`, whose fields
# are {replayed, response, status} — no `errors` — but it WRAPS a response that
# has one. A transitive predicate pulls in six best-effort Slack / activity-feed /
# audit-log handlers whose failure leaves the response byte-identical.
#
# Resolution of a newly-in-scope site is at the SOURCE with a `# structural-guard:`
# marker carrying the spec citation (the mechanism already used at
