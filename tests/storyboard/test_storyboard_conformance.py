"""Storyboard-conformance grading via pytest (the storyboard-conformance job).

Grades a MEASURED run of the real ``@adcp/sdk`` storyboard runner (never
re-derived/inferred) as ordinary parametrized pytest tests, one per
``(protocol, track, storyboard_id, step_id)`` — reusing the exact
ledger/xfail/lock-test discipline ``tests/bdd/e2e_rest_known_failures.txt``
already established (``tests/storyboard/known_failures.txt`` +
``tests/storyboard/conftest.py``) instead of a second hand-rolled comparator
system (Core Invariant).

The runner is executed once per PROTOCOL. The agent serves both MCP and A2A and
the compliance checks apply to both, so grading only MCP would let the A2A
surface drift non-conformant with CI green. Each protocol gets its own agent
URL, its own summary artifact, and its own ledger namespace (test ids are
prefixed ``mcp::`` / ``a2a::``) — sharing any of the three would have the second
run silently overwrite the first.

Runner-reported skips (``missing_test_controller``, ``missing_tool``,
``prerequisite_failed``, ...) become native ``pytest.skip()`` calls — they are
never ledger entries. Only a genuine check FAILURE is ledgered.

Requires a live in-network stack and the runner's npm deps + the pinned
compliance/schema bundle (see ``tests/storyboard/runner/``; CI downloads it via
``.github/actions/_adcp-bundle``) — this module cannot be collected meaningfully without that
environment, matching how ``tests/bdd``'s e2e_rest transport and ``tests/e2e``
already require a live stack to collect.

#
# A2A takes the agent's BASE url, NOT its JSON-RPC endpoint. A2A is card-first:
# the SDK calls buildCardUrls(), which appends `/.well-known/agent.json` then
# `/.well-known/agent-card.json` to the url verbatim — it does NOT strip a
# transport suffix the way computeBaseUrl() does. Passing the url WITH its `/a2a`
# suffix therefore asks for `/a2a/.well-known/agent-card.json`, which 404s (verified
# live against the e2e stack), and the runner reports the agent unreachable without
# grading anything. From the base url the card is found at
# `/.well-known/agent-card.json` and the RPC endpoint (`/a2a`) comes off the card.
#
# The agent is `adcp-server-storyboard`, NOT the `adcp-server` behind `proxy` that the
# other in-network suites drive. It is the same image, the same database and the same
# anchored configuration, differing in one variable: ENVIRONMENT=production, so the
# boundary runs `extra="ignore"` and DROPS a property this seller's schemas do not
# declare instead of refusing it. That is what a deployed seller does, and a conformance
# storyboard grades a deployed seller. Under the development strictness the other suites
# want, the five read tools answered INVALID_REQUEST to a request carrying
# `idempotency_key` -- a field AdCP 3.1 puts on every task request and
# compliance/universal/read-tool-idempotency.yaml requires sellers to TOLERATE.
#
# ONE ORIGIN, BOTH PROTOCOLS. Same host, same TLS front, same Host header, therefore the
# same tenant resolution and the same published identity — differing only in the path,
# which the protocols themselves fix. That sameness is the POINT of grading two surfaces:
# what the axes are for is proving one deployment behaves the same either way, and two
# axes on two origins compare nothing. A green A2A reached by dialing it differently from
# MCP is a label, not evidence.
#
# The origin is `storyboard.adcp.test:8443`, behind `tls-proxy` (alias in
# docker-compose.e2e.yml, SNI map in config/nginx/nginx-tls-test.conf.template) rather
# than the service on plaintext :8080 — and A2A is why the scheme has to be real. A2A is
# card-first: the runner reads the RPC endpoint off `/.well-known/agent-card.json` rather
# than being told it, and `src/app.py`'s `get_protocol` renders **https** for any host
# that is not loopback. Dialed plaintext, the card published
# `https://adcp-server-storyboard:8080/a2a` — TLS to a plaintext port — so every
# card-derived call failed with `fetch failed`: 25 checks on run sa-0c74d963, one of them
# the capability probe the runner SELECTS storyboards from, which is why that axis
# executed 25 storyboards where MCP executed 44 and passed 3 where MCP passed 33. The card
# was right and the origin was wrong. This front forwards `Host` verbatim and sets
# `X-Forwarded-Proto`, the signal `get_protocol` prefers, so what it publishes is what it
# speaks.
#
# MCP takes its endpoint directly (`/mcp/`, trailing slash included — FastMCP mounts it
# that way). A2A takes the BASE url: the SDK appends `/.well-known/...` verbatim, so a
# `/a2a` suffix would ask for `/a2a/.well-known/agent-card.json`, which 404s.
