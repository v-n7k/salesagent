"""E2E: a counterparty resolves our signing keys from our published trust root.

TDD RED for #1291 A3 (salesagent-z6nr.9), step 9 as amended by R-H2.

This walks the SDK's own three-hop discovery (``adcp.signing.async_resolve_agent``)
against the live Docker stack, and is the only test in the A3 suite that grades
the documents as a real counterparty consumes them rather than as we build them.

Two deliberate seams, each with its reason:

1. **Hop 1 is seeded** (``_capabilities_client_factory``). Two independent reasons,
   and either alone would be sufficient:

   * *SDK divergence #4.* ``_fetch_capabilities`` does a raw ``GET <agent_url>``
     and requires a JSON object body, while security.mdx:1142 says the opposite
     verbatim — "invoke ``get_adcp_capabilities`` via the agent's declared
     transport (MCP ``tools/call`` or A2A skill invocation), **not** a raw HTTP
     ``GET``". Our ``/mcp`` answers GET with a redirect to an SSE stream and
     ``/a2a`` is JSON-RPC POST, so an unseeded hop 1 fails no matter what A3
     publishes.
   * *This module grades A3, whose scope stops at the published documents.* Seeding
     hop 1 from A3's own helpers is what keeps a failure here attributable to
     brand.json or the JWKS rather than to the capabilities builder.

   ``identity`` is no longer gated: publishing the trust root is what took it out
   of ``_UNBACKED_BLOCKS`` (``src/core/schemas/capability_declarations.py``), and
   ``emitted_identity`` (``src/core/signing/posture.py``) puts it on the wire — so
   the served capabilities document really does carry it. Grading THAT document —
   fetched, not seeded — is ``test_jwks_publication_e2e`` (salesagent-mp53.7), not
   this module.

   So the seeded body's ``identity`` is built from **A3's own** helpers, and the
   test asserts the values the resolver ends up using are those helpers' output.

2. **Hops 2 and 3 are live.** No ``_brand_jwks_client_factory`` is passed —
   brand.json and the JWKS are fetched from the running stack over real HTTP,
   because those two hops are the ones A3 owns.

``allow_private_destinations=True`` is a TEST argument only: it relaxes the SDK's
SSRF pin so an ``http://localhost:<port>`` stack is reachable. No production path
reads it: the inbound verifier (``src/core/signing/verifier.py``) pins it ``False``
on every resolution walk, and ``src/core/config.py`` deliberately exposes no knob
for it. This module can pass ``True`` precisely because it calls
``async_resolve_agent`` itself rather than going through that verifier.

    The sibling above walks the same chain over plaintext and stays exactly as it
    is; this one is additive. What it adds is the ONE thing plaintext cannot
    grade: that a host for which ``_get_protocol_for_domain`` answers ``https``
    can actually complete a TLS handshake and serve its own JWKS at that exact
    ``host:port``. A test host earns https by serving it, never by being told to.

    Why the last leg is a real fetch and not a string check: a tenant whose

    today. Asserting ``startswith("https://")`` on such a tenant is satisfied by
    a host that serves nothing — the vacuity this whole ticket exists to remove.
