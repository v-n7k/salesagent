"""Contract: the capture service records the WIRE, and answers what proves control.

The request-handling contract of ``tests/e2e/webhook_capture_service.py``, in two
layers: raw-wire capture (salesagent-mp53.9, landed) and the proof-of-control ECHO
mode (salesagent-mp53.4, the TDD red at the bottom of this module). It runs the
service IN-PROCESS on loopback (no Docker, no compose network, no tls-proxy),
because the claims here are about this module's own request handling, not about
the stack wiring (that is
``tests/unit/test_architecture_e2e_webhook_capture_wiring.py`` and
``tests/e2e/test_webhook_capture_egress_gate_e2e.py``) and not about what the
server does with the answer (``tests/e2e/test_notification_proof_challenge_e2e.py``).

**Why this module exists at all, given the sibling branch already has a service.**
The version being ported (``feat/secure-outbound-fetch``) parses each request
body with ``json.loads`` and stores the resulting dict — it DISCARDS the request
headers and the exact bytes. That is fine on that branch and fatal on this one:
this branch's in-process receiver records ``received_raw`` as
``(path, headers, body_bytes)`` (``tests/e2e/_webhook_capture.py``, #1291 C1),
and ``tests/e2e/test_webhook_signature_e2e.py`` grades RFC 9421 signatures out of
it. A signature is computed over the BYTES the sender emitted and over the
``Signature`` / ``Signature-Input`` / ``Content-Digest`` headers; a service that
returns a re-serialized dict has thrown away the entire subject of that test,
and it would do so SILENTLY — the payload assertions would keep passing while
signature verification failed as ``webhook_signature_invalid``, the failure mode
most likely to be misread as a crypto bug.

**The contract this pins**, chosen to be additive so the ported consumers keep
working unchanged: ``GET``/``DELETE /webhook/<key>`` answer with BOTH

* ``received``     — the parsed JSON payloads, exactly as the sibling branch's
  service already returns them; and
* ``received_raw`` — one entry per request, ``{"path", "headers", "body_b64"}``,
  reconstituting this branch's ``(path, headers, body_bytes)`` tuple across an
  HTTP readback hop (base64 because the bytes are not necessarily text, let
  alone JSON).
