"""Long-lived webhook-capture compose service (salesagent-amht.3).

Turns ``tests/e2e/_webhook_capture.py``'s old per-test, ephemeral-port,
in-process TLS receiver into a real network service: fixed name, fixed port,
fronted by the shared ``tls-proxy`` (salesagent-amht.2) at
``webhooks.adcp.test``. That is what a webhook receiver is in production.

Two traffic patterns, never conflated:

* DELIVERY — ``adcp-server`` (or any sender) POSTs a captured payload to
  ``/webhook/<key>``. This is the path the shared TLS front terminates.
* READBACK — the test process reads/drains a key's captures over
  ``GET``/``DELETE /webhook/<key>``. This is test control-plane, plain HTTP,
  never routed through the TLS front (see ``tests/e2e/_webhook_capture.py``).

Storage is a ``dict[key, list[payload]]`` keyed by an opaque per-test token
(never a single global list) — the isolation mechanism concurrent e2e modules
under xdist depend on. ``ThreadingHTTPServer`` serves each request on its own
thread, so the store guards every read/write with an explicit
``threading.Lock`` rather than relying on GIL atomicity as the only safety
net, and ``DELETE`` drains-and-returns a key's list in one atomic round trip
(never a separate read-then-clear) so a capture landing between the two can
never be silently lost.

``GET /health`` reports this instance's own ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`` so a
readback client can assert it is talking to its own stack, not a cross-wired
sibling on the same host port (a real risk once the readback port is
published per-stack — see ``docker-compose.e2e.ports.yml``).

Runs in the compose service on a bare ``python:3.12-slim`` image — no project
dependencies, no build step (see docker-compose.e2e.yml's ``webhook-capture``
service comment for why: ``Dockerfile.test`` bakes a multi-minute
playwright/chromium install this service has no use for). That constraint once forced
the thread-serving bootstrap to be INLINED rather than imported from
``tests.helpers.local_http_origin.serve_in_thread``, the otherwise-obvious reuse
target: importing anything under ``tests.helpers`` ran its package
``__init__.py``, which eagerly imported ``tests.factories`` (``factory-boy`` et
al.) — dev-only dependencies a bare stdlib image does not have, and the
container exited on import before ever binding a socket. That package now
re-exports lazily, so the leaf helper imports with nothing but the stdlib and
the copy is gone. This module and its two package ``__init__.py`` files stay
stdlib-only, so ``python -m tests.e2e.webhook_capture_service`` still never
touches the heavy chain.
