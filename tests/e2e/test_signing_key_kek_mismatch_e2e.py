"""salesagent-dn4i — the LIVE SERVER cannot open a key minted under a different KEK.

**PROVES.** A key encrypted under one KEK, minted directly against the shared
database by THIS TEST PROCESS (simulating an out-of-band/misconfigured
minting path), is correctly declared unusable by the LIVE SERVER container,
which holds a DIFFERENT KEK (docker-compose.e2e.yml's ``ADCP_SIGNING_DEV_KEK``)
and was never told about the runner's. Fetched over real HTTPS from the live
server, ``webhook_signing.supported`` must be honestly ``false`` — never
raising at delivery time, never silently ``true``.

**DOES NOT PROVE.** That a signature exists or verifies — no signing happens
anywhere in this test. The precondition is only that a JWKS is published and
fetchable (salesagent-mp53.7), not that the server can sign.

Why this MUST be a two-process test, not an in-process one (this ticket's own
acceptance text): an in-process test simulates the second process, which is
exactly how commit 93954ea59 went green while its stated mechanism was false.
This module's whole point is to be the honest version: the runner and the
live server are genuinely different OS processes holding genuinely different
KEK values in genuinely different environments.

tests/integration/test_signing_key_kek_mismatch.py already pins the LOGIC
in-process (the predicate itself) — this module pins the two-process
PROPERTY that logic exists to serve.
