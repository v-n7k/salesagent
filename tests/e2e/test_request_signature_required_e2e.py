"""E2E-2 (narrowed to the refused leg): an unauthenticated, unsigned request to a
``required_for`` operation is refused, over real HTTP, on REST and MCP.

#1291 — the inbound verifier (B1/B2) had zero real-HTTP coverage; a later
finding made the gap concrete: the in-process a2a/mcp legs never traverse the
ASGI stack, so before this module the verifier's evidence was one in-process leg
plus two simulations.

**PROVES.** The composition rule (security.mdx @ v3.1.1 :1268-1271) — refuse an
unauthenticated, unsigned request to a declared ``required_for`` operation with
``request_signature_required`` — is enforced by the DEPLOYED stack, driven
through nginx/TLS over a real socket, against a real
``tenants.capability_declarations`` row (written through
``provisioned_trust_root_tenant``'s ``declarations_from_tenant`` hook, the same
mechanism ``test_jwks_publication_e2e.py`` uses — a second, separate
``TenantConfigUoW`` write from inside the test body was tried first and found
NOT visible to the live server's read: it opens its own ``get_db_session()``
engine, a different SQLAlchemy engine object than ``live_db_env``'s
``create_engine(live_server["postgres"])``, see the local comment on
``signing_declarations``), on BOTH REST and MCP naming surfaces (the ticket's own
motivating gap).

**WHERE THE RULE LIVES — and why that decides what this module must send.**
Verification runs inside the ONE resolver,
``src.core.resolved_identity._resolve_identity``, reached only from
``src.core.tools._boundary.invoke_tool`` (docs/development/request-lifecycle.md
§ Identity); the typed
``AdCPRequestSignatureError`` it raises is lifted to ``401`` +
``WWW-Authenticate: Signature error="<code>"`` by ``AuthChallengeResponder``
(``src/core/auth_middleware.py``), app-wide middleware that reads the AdCP code
off a FINISHED JSON body and therefore answers REST, MCP, A2A and JSON-RPC from
one renderer. Three consequences this module is built around, each of which
silently produced a NON-401 under the old module's request shapes:

1. **The payload is validated BEFORE the caller is resolved.** ``serve()`` is
   ``invoke_tool(name, validated_request(name, raw, protocol), ...)``, and
   ``validated_request`` is a plain ``dto.model_validate(raw)``. An operation
   whose DTO has required fields never reaches the verifier on an empty body —
   ``create_media_buy`` (this module's original choice) requires five, so
   ``json={}`` was answered with a validation envelope, not a challenge.
2. **A credential-requiring operation is refused on its BEARER first.**
   ``_resolve_identity`` step 2 raises ``AUTH_MISSING`` for an anonymous caller
   on a row whose impl takes ``ResolvedIdentity``, well above step 4b. Only a
   PUBLIC row (``PublicIdentity``) lets an anonymous unsigned request travel far
   enough for the composition rule to be the thing that refuses it.
3. **MCP now answers inside FastMCP, not above it.** The mount is
   ``mcp.http_app(path="/", json_response=True, stateless_http=True)``
   (``src/app.py:128``). Stateless means no ``initialize`` handshake is needed
   (``mcp.server.session`` marks a stateless session Initialized on
   construction), but the SDK still rejects a POST whose ``Accept`` omits
   ``application/json`` with ``406`` before any dispatch
   (``mcp/server/streamable_http.py::_validate_accept_header``). httpx's default
   ``Accept: */*`` does not satisfy it, so the frame must name the media types.

So the graded operation here is ``list_creative_formats``: a public row
(``requires_credential()`` is unconditionally False — its DTO declares no
``brand``, so the tenant's ``brand_manifest_policy`` cannot escalate it the way
it can ``get_products``) whose DTO validates ``{}``. It is the ONLY shape that
reaches step 4b anonymously, which is what makes a ``request_signature_required``
challenge attributable to the composition rule and nothing else.

**DOES NOT PROVE.**
* The accepted-signed branch — that is the sibling module,
  ``test_request_signature_accepted_e2e.py``.
* The a2a ``message/send`` naming path, over real HTTP — out of scope for this
  ticket; if wanted, file as a follow-up.
* Bearer-authenticated-but-unsigned pass-through (security.mdx :1269's OTHER
  branch) — not asserted here.

**Host-routing collision — the real mechanism, not the tenant id.**
``ix_tenants_virtual_host`` is UNIQUE and every signing e2e module provisions at
the SAME TLS netloc, so a distinct ``_TENANT_ID``/``_SLUG`` (not colliding with
``tr_e2e``/``tr_e2e_tls``/``jwkspub_e2e``/``dn4i_e2e``/``whsig_e2e``) does NOT by
itself prevent a collision — it only makes the blame land in the right module
when one happens. What actually prevents it is the serial e2e run (``tox -e
e2e``, no ``-n``) plus ``drop_tenant`` at both ends of every module. A tenant
leaked by a crashed teardown surfaces here as an ``IntegrityError`` in THIS
module's fixture setup.

**How to run it.** Via ``saci run e2e`` (the WHOLE e2e suite via tox's
``[testenv:e2e]``, against the live server's ``adcp`` database) — NOT ``saci run
ci <file>``, which bypasses tox and resolves the wrong database (``adcp_test``)
for this suite, AND NOT ``saci run e2e -- -k <test name>``, which the current
``run_all_tests.sh`` argument contract treats as an explicit suite list — ``e2e``
is captured, everything after it is silently discarded, so the ``-k`` filter
never reaches pytest (confirmed against ``run_all_tests.sh`` and
``run_all_tests_host.sh`` source, #1291 mp53.6). There is currently no supported
way to target a single e2e file/test while keeping the correct database.

**Mutations that must turn it RED** (the three assertions are independent):
disabling the ``bucket != "required"`` early return in
``src.core.signing.verifier._refuse_unsigned_if_required`` takes the control to a
401; passing ``declarations_from_tenant=None`` to
``provisioned_trust_root_tenant`` takes the served ``required_for`` to ``[]`` and
both refusals to a 200; dropping the ``www-authenticate`` append in
``src.core.auth_middleware._flush`` takes both ``rejection_code()`` reads to
``None``.
