"""E2E transport for the tenant-scoped admin route tests of #2203.

The contract lives in tests/admin/test_tenant_scoped_routes_auth.py. Importing its three
classes here collects them a second time against the ``scoping_env`` below, which drives the
same harness through ``requests.Session`` against nginx -> FastAPI -> admin blueprints, as
tests/e2e/test_admin_bdd_e2e.py does for BR-ADMIN-ACCOUNTS.

Requires: ADCP_SALES_PORT set (Docker stack running). The stack runs with
ADCP_AUTH_TEST_MODE=true; the harness logs in through ``/test/auth`` as the non-admin
``test_tenant_user`` identity against a tenant that is never the target, which keeps the
test-mode bypass out of every membership decision.
