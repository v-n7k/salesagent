"""E2E transport for the tenant-scoped admin route tests of #2203.

The contract classes live in tests/helpers/admin_tenant_scoping_contract.py. Importing them
here collects them against the ``scoping_env`` below, which drives the same harness through
``requests.Session`` against nginx -> FastAPI -> admin blueprints.

Requires the Docker stack: ``docker_services_e2e`` supplies the admin port, and
``admin_stack_env`` (tests/e2e/conftest.py) hands the env that ``base_url``. The stack runs with
ADCP_AUTH_TEST_MODE=true; the harness logs in through ``/test/auth`` as the non-admin
``test_tenant_user`` identity against a tenant that is never the target, which keeps the
test-mode bypass out of every membership decision.
