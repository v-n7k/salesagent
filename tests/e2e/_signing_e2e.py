"""Shared seams for the #1291 signing e2e suite (salesagent-mp53).

Every module in the suite needs the same four things, and each of them has
exactly ONE home:

* **TLS origin and CA bundle** — NOT here. ``tests/e2e/conftest.py`` already owns
  the env-var reading (:func:`~tests.e2e.conftest.e2e_tls_base_url`,
  :func:`~tests.e2e.conftest.e2e_ca_bundle`); :func:`tls_base_url` and
  :func:`ca_bundle` below only add the loud assertions the signing suite needs
  on top of them. A signing test that cannot find the TLS listener or the CA
  must FAIL, never skip — a skipped https test and a passing http one are the
  same green.
* **The tenant seam** — :func:`provisioned_trust_root_tenant`, which owns the
  ``virtual_host`` routing state the whole e2e session shares.
* **The hop-1 seed** — :func:`seeded_capabilities_factory`, needed because the
  SDK's capabilities hop raw-GETs the agent URL (SDK divergence #4, see
  ``test_trust_root_e2e``).
* **Production-path key provisioning** — :func:`provision_signing_key_via_admin`,
  which drives the real admin route over real HTTP so the row is minted under
  the SERVER CONTAINER's KEK rather than the test runner's.
* **The keyless-declaring-tenant fixture factory** — :func:`declaring_tenant_provisioner`
  — and **the anonymous capabilities fetch** — :func:`fetch_capabilities` — both needed
  by every module whose phase A proves a tenant that DECLARES a signing posture but owns
  no key yet (``mint_key=False``): the key must arrive later through a production
  transport, or the module grades its own fixture.

    and the request is signed by a counterparty the live server resolves through the
    real ``agent_url -> capabilities -> brand.json -> jwks_uri`` walk.

    ONE builder, not a second copy. ``build_e2e_signing_capability`` mints the key,
    publishes it at a SLOT of its own on the counterparty origin (so no two callers
    share the server's hour-long ``AGENT_RESOLUTION_CACHE`` entry), reads the published
    trust root back the way the server will read it — failing HERE, naming the origin,
    rather than three assertions later as an unresolvable key — and records the
    ``agent_url`` on the principal row the verifier resolves the bearer to. Every one of
    those steps has already been got wrong once; a second implementation beside it is
    how the two end up signing against a keyset the other published.

    A UNIQUE dotted ``virtual_host`` is set FIRST, and that is the whole reason this
    seam sets one at all. ``ensure_declarable_identity_host`` — which the builder calls
    unconditionally — assigns the SHARED CONSTANT ``SIGNING_AGENT_HOST`` to any tenant
    whose host carries no dot, and ``ix_tenants_virtual_host`` is UNIQUE across a
    database that ``tests/e2e`` shares for a whole randomly-ordered session. A second
    row already holding that constant turns this into a ``UniqueViolation`` on the
    UPDATE. The predicate that guards the assignment is only "has a dot" (its own
    docstring gives the reason: ``_get_protocol_for_domain`` derives ``https`` for a
    dotted host, which is what ``identity.brand_json_url``'s ``^https://`` needs), so a
    per-invocation dotted host satisfies the contract AND makes the harness's assignment
    a no-op — no change to the shared constant, which the in-process legs pin, and no
    second assignment path.

    RESTORES what it touched, because ``tests/e2e`` shares that one database: the
    buyer's ``agent_url`` and the tenant's ``virtual_host``. The second is not inert —
    ``virtual_host`` is host-routing state AND the value
    ``Product.publisher_properties`` falls back to for ``publisher_domain``
    (``src/core/database/models.py``), so inside the window the tenant's products report
    the signing host instead of ``<subdomain>.example.com``. Tenant resolution is
    unaffected (every request in this suite carries an ``x-adcp-tenant`` hint, and no
    test dials that host), the e2e suite runs serially, and both columns are put back on
    exit — so the only lasting effect is a keyset published at a slot nothing else
    names. A caller that ASSERTS on ``publisher_domain`` must not wrap that assertion in
    this context manager.

    ``tenant_id`` — which is half of its composite primary key. The FK's
    ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` only applies to a database-level delete.

    And the deployed schema does not have the cascade the models claim. ``AuditLog``
    was already in this list for that reason; the same gap covers three more tables:
    ``initial_schema.py`` created ``principals``, ``products``, ``media_buys`` and

    ``virtual_host`` is set to the stack's own host:port so that
    ``canonical_agent_url`` resolves to somewhere a resolver can actually reach —
    otherwise the hops below would be pointed at a domain that does not exist and
    the test would grade nothing. That is not hypothetical: 635 of 638
    ``TenantFactory`` sites leave ``virtual_host`` NULL, which makes the server
    derive ``<subdomain>.sales-agent.example.com`` — already dotted, so already
    https, at a host that serves no JWKS. A test written against one of those
    passes vacuously.

    ``get_tenant_by_virtual_host`` (``src/core/config_loader.py``) is an EXACT
    string match against the Host header, so *host* must carry the port whenever
    the client will send one.

    *mint_key* is False for a tenant whose key must be provisioned through a
    PRODUCTION path instead (see :func:`provision_signing_key_via_admin`) — a
    runner-minted key grades the fixture, and is encrypted under the runner's KEK
    rather than the server container's.

    *declarations_from_tenant* receives the just-built tenant so a declaration can
    carry ``identity.brand_json_url`` DERIVED from it (``src.core.agent_identity``)
    rather than a literal, which is what ``validate_signing_platform_backing``
    cross-checks.

    *buyer_access_token* is opt-in and default-off. Passing one additionally seeds the
    principal / adapter config / property tag / product / pricing option a live
    ``create_media_buy`` needs (:func:`_seed_buying_surface`), authenticated by that
    exact literal — which is how a caller that must DRIVE this tenant gets a usable
    token without the yield growing a third element. Callers that pass nothing get
    byte-for-byte the tenant they got before.

    *counterparty_principals* maps ``access_token -> agent_url`` and seeds one Principal
    per entry. ``Principal.agent_url`` is the ONLY legitimate source for an inbound
    counterparty's identity (security.mdx forbids taking it from a header or a body
    field) and it is the sole input to the verifier's key-resolution walk
    (``_resolve_identity`` -> ``verify_inbound_signature`` -> ``_verify_signed`` ->
    ``_resolution_for``), so a module grading the INBOUND signed path needs a principal
    that carries one — which
    :func:`_seed_buying_surface` deliberately does not create (``PrincipalFactory``
    leaves the nullable column NULL). Two entries rather than one is the ordinary case
    there: a counterparty whose brand.json lists it and one whose does not resolve to
    two DIFFERENT ``agent_url`` values, and ``AGENT_RESOLUTION_CACHE`` is keyed on
    exactly that, so they cannot collide.

    Note that the session below stays bound for the whole ``yield``: a caller cannot
    open a second ``live_db_env`` from its test body, so anything that must be seeded
    belongs in the seed above rather than in the test.

    the server container: the report is built from the server's own delivery poll,
    routed through the one signing boundary, and posted by the deployment under test.

    Why an admin route rather than the harness's in-process ``WebhookDeliveryService``:
    a delivery made in the test process is one the live server never made, so a leg
    grading it grades nothing about the deployment (salesagent-n78j0.1.4). Same
    admin-over-HTTP shape — and the same session/POST/render helper — as
    :func:`provision_signing_key_via_admin`, for the same reason.

    ``force=True`` is what the route passes, so neither the daily-frequency filter nor
    the 24-hour duplicate check can silently turn a requested delivery into a no-op.

    THREE OUTCOMES, and collapsing them to two is the defect this shape exists to avoid:

    * the SENT flash            -> ``True``   — the server sent one;
    * the DECLINED flash        -> ``False``  — the server considered it and declined.

      ``False`` for exactly this; raising here instead made the same operation mean two
      different things depending on transport, which is the fault this atom exists to
      remove — and it made "webhook fires for a media buy WITHOUT webhook configuration"
      ungradeable over the wire, because a correct decline read as a broken rig.
    * NEITHER flash             -> RAISE. Kept strict deliberately: it is what caught an
      ``HTTP 404 'Media buy not found'`` that a laxer reading would have recorded as a
      decline. "No flash at all" and "the failure flash" are different facts.

    KNOWN CONFLATION, recorded rather than solved: the DECLINED flash covers BOTH
    "declined because no reporting_webhook is configured" (a verdict) and "the delivery
    poll returned errors so it declined to send" (arguably a rig problem). The route does
    not distinguish them, so neither can this. Mapping both to ``False`` is right for the
