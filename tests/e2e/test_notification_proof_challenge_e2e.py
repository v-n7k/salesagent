"""E2E-4: the proof-of-control challenge is signed, conformant and echo-checked over real HTTP.

salesagent-mp53.4 (#1291 C2) — the sibling of ``tests/integration/test_notification_proof_challenge.py``
on a real socket. That module drives ``sync_accounts`` in-process and replaces the SOCKET
and DNS; this one changes nothing at all. The server container signs with a key it holds
under its own KEK, opens a real TLS connection to a real HTTPS receiver, and the receiver's
answer decides whether the subscriber is persisted active.

**Why an e2e module exists for a surface an integration module already grades.**
``NotificationProofService.prove`` refuses at five gates BEFORE any socket opens, and the
last two of them — the uncredentialed-legacy check and ``validate_url(url,
provenance=CounterpartyUrl(field=None))`` — cannot be exercised honestly with the socket
replaced: an in-process module answers those gates against a stub. On this stack they run
for real against a destination production accepts ON ITS OWN TERMS. That is the measured
hole the epic named: "the BDD harness replaces the prover with a MagicMock; the e2e path
returns before the POST" (``tests/harness/account_sync.py`` says so in its own error text —
``set_notification_proof_result(succeeds=True)`` has NO e2e realization, and the e2e
failure direction is realized by a reserved-TLD url, i.e. a refusal at gate 2).

**PROVES.**

1. The challenge POST that leaves the server container carries an RFC 9421 signature that
   verifies — over the exact BYTES on the wire, under the WEBHOOK profile tag, against a
   JWKS resolved from the ``seller_agent_url`` the challenge itself named.
2. Its body is EXACTLY the seven properties ``webhook-challenge.json`` requires, with no
   ``idempotency_key`` (the field the SDK's ``WebhookSender.send_raw`` would have injected
   — a sender this codebase no longer builds at all, see below).
3. Activation depends on the ECHO. The SAME receiver, answering 2xx WITHOUT the echo,
   does not activate the subscriber; answering with the echo does.
4. The fail-closed leg — a tenant holding no signing key — refuses BEFORE the POST, with
   zero captures on a receiver that would otherwise have captured.
5. The challenge does NOT vary by the transport the registration arrived on. The same
   subscriber registered over REST is challenged with the SAME ``seller_agent_url`` and
   activates, because that field names the tenant's published agent — one origin, one key
   set, one webhook sender — rather than the door the buyer came through
   (``accounts.py::_challenge_signing``, which takes a tenant id and nothing else;
   ``ResolvedIdentity`` carries no ``protocol`` on this architecture, so a
   per-arrival-transport identity is not expressible on this side of the boundary).

**DOES NOT PROVE.** That the signature fails to verify under swapped key material, or
that the discovery chain is well formed — those are ``test_webhook_signature_e2e``'s
(E2E-3) negative control and discovery walk, and keeping them apart is what makes a
failure here attributable to the CHALLENGE path.

## The Core Invariant, and what it forbids this module from doing

*The challenge is either a real, RFC 9421-signed POST of the exact seven-field
``webhook.challenge`` document whose ECHO decides activation, or it is not sent at all —
and this module may only ever make production's own gates PASS, never bypass them.*

So nothing here patches ``validate_url``, ``is_reserved_tld_host`` or
``get_notification_proof_service``, and nothing reaches
``WebhookURLValidator.validate_webhook_url_registration`` (the DNS-free, REGISTRATION-time
wrapper over the same egress seam, which this fire-time path deliberately does not call).
The receiver is reachable because it genuinely satisfies both gates:
``webhooks.adcp-e2e.dev`` is a normal delegable gTLD name, not an RFC 6761 special-use
one, and it resolves into this stack's own NON-private per-stack subnet. That the gate is
still ARMED inside this stack
— 127.0.0.1, RFC1918, link-local and the metadata address all still refused — is graded
by ``tests/e2e/test_webhook_capture_egress_gate_e2e.py``, which is what keeps "we reached
it" distinguishable from "we disarmed it".

``webhooks.adcp.test`` would NOT work and is not a naming preference: AdCP 3.1.1 lists
``.test`` among the RFC 6761 names the SSRF path MUST refuse, and
``notification_proof_service`` applies ``is_reserved_tld_host`` unconditionally BEFORE the
SSRF check, so a ``.test`` receiver is refused before a socket opens.

## Why the fail-closed leg points at the SAME receiver the success leg proves reachable

Gate 3 ("this challenge cannot be signed") short-circuits BEFORE gate 5 (the egress
seam's ``validate_url``). A fail-closed leg pointed at a plain-HTTP or unreachable
receiver would still show zero captures under a mutation that REMOVED the refusal under
test, because control would fall through to ``validate_url`` and be refused there
instead. Zero captures is evidence only when the receiver WOULD have captured — which is
why the keyless leg dials the same https origin the proven leg reaches.

## Mutations this module is built to fail under, and where each goes red

* remove the echo requirement from ``_response_proves_control`` (accept any 2xx) →
  red at the NO-ECHO leg, which would then activate;
* remove the ``signing is None`` refusal in ``prove`` → red at the KEYLESS leg (a
  challenge would be POSTed and captured). This is the mutation the architect review
  added as MEDIUM-2, and it only discriminates because that leg dials a reachable
  receiver;
* re-introduce an arrival-transport gate in ``_challenge_signing`` — return ``None``, or
  a DIFFERENT ``seller_agent_url``, for a registration that arrived over REST → red at
  the REST leg, which asserts both that it was challenged at all and that the url it
  named byte-equals the one the A2A leg named;
* drop the ``strategy.build_auth_headers`` call in ``send_signed_challenge`` → red at the
  three-headers assertion;
* route the challenge back through a delivery sender that injects ``idempotency_key``
  (the SDK's ``WebhookSender.send_raw``; this codebase builds no ``WebhookSender`` at all
  — ``send_signed_challenge`` dials the egress seam directly) → red at the
  exact-seven-keys assertion.

## Spec, at the version this repo pins (AdCP 3.1.1 via ``adcp==6.6.0``)

``v3.1.1:docs/accounts/tasks/sync_accounts.mdx`` § "Endpoint proof of control":

* :207 — "The challenge POST itself MUST be signed with the seller's RFC 9421 webhook
  profile key even when the candidate config selects legacy delivery auth … The receiver
  MUST verify the RFC 9421 signature and MUST reject the challenge unless
  ``seller_agent_url``, ``delivery_auth``, and ``event_types`` match the pending
  registration."
* :209 — "The standard challenge is an HTTPS POST to the candidate ``url`` with a JSON
  body containing ``type``, ``challenge``, ``account_id``, ``subscriber_id``,
  ``seller_agent_url``, ``delivery_auth``, and ``event_types``." Those SEVEN, and
  ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/core/webhook-challenge.json`` is ``additionalProperties: false``
  with all seven ``required``.
* :223-233 — "The receiver proves control by returning HTTP ``2xx`` with a JSON body
  containing exactly one echo field", plus the backward-compatible ``token`` alias.
* :235 — the challenge value MUST be cryptographically random and single-use; a failed,
  non-2xx, malformed, mismatched or timed-out challenge means proof FAILED.
* :237 — on proof failure the seller returns ``action: "failed"`` with
  ``errors[].code: "VALIDATION_ERROR"`` and ``error.field`` pointing at
  ``accounts[i].notification_configs[j].url``.

No 3.1.1 conformance storyboard grades this surface — ``notification-config-lifecycle.yaml``
puts active registration out of scope — so the assertions here and in the integration
sibling are the only graders that exist.

## In-network only, and why that is a skip rather than a failure

The capture service publishes NO host port: its readback control plane is reachable only
by compose service name. The skip below is therefore the same host-vs-in-network gate
``test_webhook_capture_egress_gate_e2e`` uses, and nothing else in this module may skip —
every precondition inside a run RAISES, because degrading a missing precondition to a
skip would report it as success. ``./run_all_tests.sh`` runs every suite in-network, so
the skip path is the developer convenience, not CI.
