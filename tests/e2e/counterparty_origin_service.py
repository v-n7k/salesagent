"""Static counterparty identity origin for the e2e signing suite (salesagent-mp53.8).

The live server's INBOUND verifier resolves an unknown counterparty by WALKING
its published trust root — ``adcp.signing.agent_resolver.async_resolve_agent``:

    GET <agent_url>                     -> capabilities, whose
                                           ``identity.brand_json_url`` names ...
    GET <brand_json_url>                -> brand.json, whose ``agents[]`` entry
                                           for that url carries ``jwks_uri`` ...
    GET <jwks_uri>                      -> the JWKS the signature is verified against

This service is the other end of that walk. It exists because the SELLER'S OWN
published trust root cannot be reused as the counterparty: ``_fetch_capabilities``
does a raw ``GET`` with ``follow_redirects=False`` and demands a 200 carrying a
JSON object, while our ``/mcp`` answers ``GET`` with an SSE redirect (an SDK
divergence from ``security.mdx``:1142, which says to invoke
``get_adcp_capabilities`` over the declared transport). Hop 1 would die on our
own route.

It is a SIBLING of ``tests/e2e/webhook_capture_service.py``, not a mode inside it.
What would be shared is ~30 lines of ``BaseHTTPRequestHandler`` — not the
duplication class worth collapsing — while the coupling would be real: that
service's other mode records raw bytes for the signing suite and its ``do_POST``
semantics must not bleed into an identity origin.

TWO agents on ONE origin, differing ONLY in which brand.json their capabilities
document points at:

* ``/agent/listed``   -> ``/.well-known/brand.json``          (lists it   -> Tier 3 PASSES)
* ``/agent/unlisted`` -> ``/.well-known/brand-unlisted.json`` (omits it   -> Tier 3 REFUSES)

That pair is what makes "resolvable via the PUBLISHED TRUST ROOT" a wire fact
rather than an inference: without the unlisted sibling, a regression that skipped
Tier 3 or routed to the config registry would produce a byte-identical 2xx AND an
identical metric increment. ``AGENT_RESOLUTION_CACHE`` is keyed on agent_url, so
the two cannot collide in the server's cache.

The JWKS is INSTALLED at runtime over ``PUT /_control/jwks`` rather than baked in,
so keys are minted fresh per run by ``keypair_for()`` and no private material is
committed. That control plane is fixture setup — scenery, like a seeded tenant
row — not a seam in anything under test.

Stdlib-only, and deliberately so: it runs on a bare ``python:3.12-slim`` compose
service with no project dependencies. Importing anything under ``tests.helpers``
would run that package's ``__init__``, which transitively pulls in ``factory-boy``.

#: The two agents above are FIXED documents shared by every consumer, which is
#: right for the accepted/unlisted PAIR (their whole point is that they differ in
#: one bit) and wrong for anyone who needs a key of their own. The server caches a
#: resolved ``AgentResolution`` — JWKS included — per ``agent_url`` for
#: ``SigningSettings.agent_resolution_ttl_seconds`` (an hour by default), in
#: ``src/core/signing/verifier.py``'s ``_resolution_for``, so a SECOND consumer of
#: ``/agent/listed`` does not merely race the first: whichever walks first pins the
#: keyset, and every key published afterwards at that url is invisible to the
#: verifier for the rest of the TTL. A slot gives each caller its own agent url,
#: hence its own cache entry, hence no interference — across xdist workers, across
#: suites, and with the fixed pair above.
#:
#: A slot is an AGENT, never a KEY LOCATION. The server reads a counterparty's keys
#: from ``<agent origin>/.well-known/jwks.json`` and nowhere else
#: (``docs/design/request-signing-subset.md``), and a well-known path is one per
#: ORIGIN — so every slot's brand.json points at that one document and the keysets
#: installed at each slot are served there together, selected by ``kid`` exactly as
#: the SDK selects within any JWKS. What the slot still isolates is what it was for:
#: the agent url, and therefore the cache entry.
