"""Contract tests for the long-lived webhook-capture compose service (salesagent-amht.3).

``tests/e2e/webhook_capture_service.py`` does not exist yet — this is the TDD
red step for salesagent-amht.3's implementation plan. It pins the SERVICE'S OWN
request-handling contract in-process (no Docker, no compose network, no
tls-proxy): per-key isolation, atomic drain-on-DELETE, and thread-safety under
concurrent writers. Those are claims about this module's own logic, not about
Docker/nginx wiring — the wiring itself (docker-compose.e2e.yml, the
webhooks.adcp.test nginx alias, dynamic port allocation) is re-verified by the
existing e2e suites in-network per acceptance criterion #5 ("no new unit
tests" for that part), not pinned here.

Runs with plain ``pytest tests/e2e/test_webhook_capture_service.py`` — it does
NOT use the ``live_server``/``docker_services_e2e`` fixtures, so it needs no
Docker stack.

class TestProgrammedRejections:
    """POST /control/{key} makes the service reject the next N deliveries to that key.

    THIS IS A SUB-CLAIM, NOT THE REGRESSION TEST FOR #2060. It grades
    the INSTRUMENT — whether the capture service can be made to fail on demand — and
    an instrument that works is not evidence that the thing it measures works. It
    earns its place for the opposite reason: a BROKEN instrument manufactures false
    greens, which is the exact disease this ticket exists to kill, so the instrument
    is pinned before anything is measured with it.

    What the circuit breaker actually does on the deployed server is graded by the
    e2e_rest leg of @T-UC-004-webhook-circuit-open, and whether that grading is real
    is settled by scripts/mutation-check-webhook-breaker.sh. Nothing in this file
    speaks to either.

    #2060 plan step 2. Nothing in the compose stack can currently
    make the deployed server's webhook delivery FAIL: this service answers every
    delivery 200, so the server's circuit breaker never records a failure and the
    two circuit-breaker scenarios have no way to open it for real. A per-key
    failure programme is what turns "the endpoint has failed 5 consecutive
    delivery attempts" from a dictionary seeded in the test process into
    something the deployed server actually experiences.

    Two invariants are load-bearing for the scenarios that will use it, and both
    are graded below:

    * A REJECTED request is still RECORDED. The Then steps count what the
      endpoint received; a rejection that vanished from the captures would make
      the five real failures indistinguishable from five suppressed deliveries.
    * The programme is CONSUMED PER REQUEST, so the key falls back to 200 once
      it is spent. That fallback is what "the webhook endpoint has recovered and
      returns 200" becomes.

    The status used here is 418 rather than a 5xx on purpose (plan step 3): a
    terminal 4xx costs exactly one request per breaker failure, while a
    retryable 5xx multiplies the count by the attempt schedule and adds seconds
    of backoff per failure (``_RETRYABLE_STATUSES``,
    ``src/core/security/egress/attempts.py``). The route itself takes whatever
    status it is given -- the choice belongs to the caller.
