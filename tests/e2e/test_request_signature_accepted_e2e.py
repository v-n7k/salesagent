"""E2E-2b (the accepted leg): a request signed by a counterparty the server resolved
by WALKING its published trust root is accepted, over real HTTP — and the acceptance
is attributed to the checklist-pass branch by a positive wire observable.

Sibling of ``test_request_signature_required_e2e.py``, which grades the refused leg
on the same tenant seam. Read them as one pair: that module proves an unsigned
request to a ``required_for`` operation is refused; this one proves a correctly
signed one is ACCEPTED, and — the part that makes it worth having — proves the
acceptance came from the verifier rather than from the verifier never running.

**Where the verifier lives now.** #1721 deleted the fourth ASGI middleware this
module was first written against (``src/core/signing/request_verifier_middleware.py``
— gone, along with its own tenant lookup and its own bodyless 401). Inbound
verification is a call the request boundary's ONE resolver makes:
``src.core.resolved_identity._resolve_identity`` step 4b ->
``src.core.signing.verifier.verify_inbound_signature``, with the tenant, the caller
and the operation already resolved. The refusal is a typed
``AdCPRequestSignatureError`` carrying the taxonomy code, and
``src.core.auth_middleware.AuthChallengeResponder`` is what turns it into 401 +
``WWW-Authenticate: Signature error="<code>"``. Every wire fact this module asserts
is unchanged by that move; only the citations below are.

**The whole point, stated first.** On the wire a checklist PASS is byte-identical to
a pass-through. Four different routes produce the same 2xx without the checklist
passing:

1. ``config.verifier_enabled == False`` — ``verify_inbound_signature`` returns at
   ``verifier.py`` :225 before anything is read;
2. ``bucket == "none"`` — a SIGNED request passes through without a CHECKLIST,
   recorded as ``record_request_unsigned(op, "ignored")``. Only the
   ``supported: false`` half is fully UNVERIFIED (``_verify_signed`` :333-335); the
   ``supported: true`` half runs ``_strict_header_precheck`` first and a malformed
   header REJECTS there (``_handle_rejection`` :395), so that route yields 2xx only
   for a well-formed signature;
3. the composition rule (``_refuse_unsigned_if_required`` :277-311, security.mdx @
   v3.1.1 :1268-1271) ALLOWS an authenticated-but-unsigned request, so a bearer-authed
   2xx proves nothing on its own — and ``get_adcp_capabilities`` is a PUBLIC registry
   row (``ToolSpec.requires_credential()`` is False for it), so an unsigned request
   with no bearer at all is served 200 anonymously unless the verifier refuses it;
4. NEW on this architecture: ``signature_subject is None``. The REST handler passes
   ``captured_exchange(request.scope)`` into ``serve``, and a scope the
   ``SignedExchangeCapture`` middleware did not capture — a path
   ``src.core.signing.capture.is_adcp_surface`` does not claim, a middleware dropped
   from ``src/app.py``'s stack — makes ``_resolve_identity`` read the request as
   "presented no signature" and verify nothing.

So a bare ``assert response.status_code == 200`` here would be exactly the disease
this module exists to kill. Each route is closed by a control that differs from the
accepted request in ONE bit and is asserted on the wire, and the acceptance itself is
graded by a POSITIVE observable rather than by the absence of a rejection.

**PROVES.**

* ``adcp_request_signature_verified_total{operation,keyid}`` increments by EXACTLY 1
  across the accepted request. ``record_signature_verified`` has exactly one call site
  in ``src/`` (``src/core/signing/verifier.py`` :391), reached only after the SDK
  checklist — Tier 3 brand authorization included, since ``_run_verifier`` passes
  ``agent_url`` and the walked ``resolution`` into ``verify_request_signature`` —
  RETURNS. So the delta is a direct read of the one line that executes only on the
  checklist-pass branch. ``src/app.py`` mounts the Flask admin (whose ``/metrics``
  route carries no ``@require_auth``) in the SAME process as the resolver, and
  ``get_metrics_text()`` reads the process-global registry, so the scrape is
  same-process, not an inference. This is PRIMARY, not decoration: control (i) alone
  passes even when the request is passing through unverified, and only the delta
  catches that.
* The three controls, each one bit away from the accepted request, on the same
  tenant / route / declaration / counterparty:
  (i)   unsigned, no bearer      -> 401 ``request_signature_required``
        [closes ``verifier_enabled=False``, ``bucket == "none"``, and the
        uncaptured-exchange route: under any of the three this request is a public
        discovery call that is SERVED 200 anonymously, so ``rejection_code()``
        returns None]
  (ii)  signed but TAMPERED — one byte flipped INSIDE the ``Signature`` value, with
        ``Signature-Input`` left well-formed so it is not a step-1 header rejection
        -> 401 ``request_signature_invalid``
        [proves the signature BYTES were graded rather than the mere presence of the
        headers]
  (iii) signed correctly         -> 2xx + the metric delta
  (iv)  signed correctly, by a counterparty whose capabilities point at a brand.json
        that does NOT list it -> 401 ``request_signature_agent_not_in_brand_json``
        [this is what makes "resolvable via the PUBLISHED TRUST ROOT" — the ticket's
        own title — a wire fact, and it is the ONLY control here that proves the
        brand.json hop RAN. Traced, not assumed: ``resolve_agent`` hop 2
        (``adcp/signing/agent_resolver.py``) reads the agent's ``jwks_uri`` out of
        the brand.json ``agents[]`` entry, so an unlisted agent fails there with
        ``BrandJsonResolverError("agent_not_found")``, which
        ``_map_brand_json_resolver_error`` (``verifier.py`` :601) maps to exactly this
        code and ``_FailedDiscoveryJwksResolver`` (:174) raises at checklist step 7.
        Tier 3 is the SECOND consumer of the same document and is simply not reached
        on this input — the walk fails first. The registry branch cannot produce this
        code at all: with no ``agent_url`` there is no walk, and an unmatched keyid
        yields the generic ``request_signature_key_unknown``. So a regression that
        resolved this key from config instead of from the published trust root —
        which would otherwise yield a byte-identical 2xx AND an identical metric
        increment — is visible here and nowhere else in this module.]
  Every 401 is read with ``rejection_code()`` (``tests/helpers/signing.py``), which
  reads ``WWW-Authenticate: Signature error="<code>"`` — the only wire signal that
  distinguishes a verifier rejection from a route-level 401. Never hand-rolled.

**DOES NOT PROVE.**

* The REGISTRY key-trust source (``settings.signing.counterparty_registry``). It is
  consulted only when ``agent_url`` is falsy (``_resolution_for`` :511-545), i.e.
  exactly when no trust root was walked, and that branch reaches no Tier 3 — so it
  cannot satisfy this module's title and is not graded here.
* The MCP and A2A naming surfaces for the accepted leg. The refused-leg sibling
  grades MCP; the accepted leg's novel evidence is the checklist-pass branch, which
  is transport-independent once the operation is named — all three transports reach
  the same ``_resolve_identity`` through ``src.core.tools._boundary.invoke_tool``.
* ``create_media_buy`` specifically. The headline request is deliberately
  ``POST /api/v1/capabilities``, which names ``get_adcp_capabilities`` — already in
  ``LADDER_OPERATIONS`` and therefore already in this tenant's declaration. Every
  field of ``GetAdcpCapabilitiesRequest`` is optional, so the ``{}`` body below
  cannot 4xx on schema validation and the leg turns on the signing outcome alone;
  a ``{}`` POST to ``/api/v1/media-buys`` would 4xx before the signing outcome is
  observable.

**Why POST, not GET.** On #1721 the REST surface is DERIVED from
``src.core.tools.registry``: one row, one verb, one path. ``get_adcp_capabilities``
declares ``RestBinding("POST", "/capabilities")`` and nothing registers a GET, so the
bodyless GET this module was first written against now 405s in FastAPI's router —
before ``serve``, before ``_resolve_identity``, before any verification. A 405 carries
no ``WWW-Authenticate``, so every control here would read ``None`` and fail for a
routing reason having nothing to do with signing. The four legs POST the same
:data:`_REQUEST_BODY` bytes, and each signature covers those bytes through
``content-digest`` exactly as ``signed_probe`` does in-process.

**Nothing in the live server is patched, relaxed or bypassed.** No
``allow_private_destinations``, no ``_capabilities_client_factory`` seam in
production, no monkeypatching across the container boundary (``verifier_spy`` and
``counterparty_key`` are TEST-PROCESS only and are unusable here by construction).
The counterparty is a real HTTPS origin on the stack's non-private per-stack subnet,
which the SDK's ``resolve_and_validate_host`` accepts on its own IP arithmetic with
its pinned ``allow_private_destinations=False`` untouched;
``tests/unit/test_architecture_no_private_destinations.py`` stays untouched. The one
piece of trust configuration added is ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` on ``adcp-server``, pointing
at a CONCATENATED bundle so the server can validate the stack CA's leaf — the
receiver-side twin of the runner's ``E2E_CA_BUNDLE``, with ``check_hostname`` and
verification fully ON. Its wiring is guarded in-process by
``tests/unit/test_architecture_e2e_counterparty_origin_wiring.py``.

**Per-leg key ids are a PRECONDITION, not a detail.** ``sign_wire_request`` /
``signed_headers`` default to the shared module constant ``COUNTERPARTY_KID``, and the
server's metric registry is cumulative for the whole e2e session. With a shared kid, a
before/after window spanning two legs reads 2 and a window around either can be
satisfied by the other. Each leg below passes an explicit distinct ``key_id=``, and the
label match filters on it — that uniqueness is what makes "exactly 1" a real claim.

**Two traps in ``signed_headers``, both closed below.**

1. It signs ``f"{origin}{path}"``. ``src.core.signing.capture._target_uri`` (:226-249)
   rebuilds the authority from the ``Host`` header nginx forwards verbatim and the
   scheme from ``X-Forwarded-Proto``, and ``_run_verifier`` passes that reconstructed
   ``exchange.url`` to the SDK rather than letting ``verify_starlette_request`` derive
   its own. So the signed origin must be the real TLS netloc INCLUDING the port. Hence
   the ``origin=`` argument.
2. ``request_headers`` unconditionally injects ``x-adcp-tenant: "sig_tenant"``, an
   in-process tenant id that does not exist in the e2e database. ``_detect_tenant``
   (``src/core/resolved_identity.py`` :230) resolves the ``Host`` header FIRST and only
   falls back to that hint, so this tenant does resolve either way here — but a header
   asserting a DIFFERENT tenant than the one being addressed is a lie inside the signed
   byte range, and one reordering of that ladder away from loading the wrong tenant,
   reading an empty posture, collapsing the bucket to ``none`` and taking the
   :333-335 UNVERIFIED pass-through: a green 2xx with zero verification, this module's
   own disease. Overridden with ``extra={"x-adcp-tenant": _TENANT_ID}``
   (``headers.update(extra)`` wins the merge).

**Host-routing collision.** ``ix_tenants_virtual_host`` is UNIQUE and every signing
e2e module provisions at the SAME TLS netloc. A distinct ``_TENANT_ID``/``_SLUG``
(colliding with none of ``tr_e2e``, ``tr_e2e_tls``, ``jwkspub_e2e``, ``dn4i_e2e``,
``whsig_e2e``, ``reqsig_e2e``) only makes the blame land here; what PREVENTS the clash
is the serial e2e run (``tox -e e2e``, no ``-n``) plus ``drop_tenant`` at both ends.

**Running it.** ``saci run e2e`` — the WHOLE e2e suite. NOT ``saci run ci <file>``
(bypasses tox and resolves the wrong database), and NOT ``saci run e2e -- -k <name>``
(the argument contract silently discards everything after the suite name). There is
no supported way to target a single e2e test while keeping the correct database.

**Mutation verification — OWED BY THE IMPLEMENTATION ATOM, not yet performed.**
This module was written as the TDD-red artifact before the counterparty origin, the
compose wiring and ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` existed, so no control here has yet been shown to
go red when the thing it grades is broken. Four mutations must be run by hand and their
observed results recorded HERE, replacing this paragraph, before the leg is called
green:

1. revert the ``x-adcp-tenant`` override on the accepted leg -> the metric delta must
   go to 0 WHILE the three controls still pass. That is the proof the metric is
   load-bearing rather than redundant with them;
2. point leg (iv) at ``brand.json`` instead of ``brand-unlisted.json`` -> it must stop
   401ing;
3. un-tamper leg (ii) -> it must stop 401ing;
4. drop ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` from ``adcp-server`` -> leg (iii) must fail as an
   unresolvable counterparty, never pass silently.
