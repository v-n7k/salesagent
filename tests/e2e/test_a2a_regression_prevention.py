A2A Regression Prevention Tests

These tests specifically target the bugs that slipped through our test coverage:
1. Agent card URLs with trailing slashes causing redirect/auth issues
2. Function call issues with core tools

The goal is to have focused, non-mocked tests that would have caught these issues.
