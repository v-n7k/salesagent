"""
E2E tests for A2A protocol compliance with AdCP schemas.

These tests validate that our A2A server correctly accepts and processes
requests according to the official AdCP specification, catching issues like:
- Incorrect parameter names (e.g., 'updates' vs 'packages')
- Missing required fields
- Schema mismatches between A2A layer and core implementation

CRITICAL: These tests use real AdCP schemas and validate the full request/response
cycle to ensure protocol compliance.

NOTE: These tests require the external AdCP schema server (adcontextprotocol.org)
to be available. If the server is unreachable (e.g., HTTP 5xx errors), tests will
be skipped rather than failing, since external service availability is outside
our control.

        day with no test edit. The previous version iterated a hand-maintained
        test-side map, which had already gone stale in both directions: it
        listed a skill production had deleted and omitted five it ships, four

        lives elsewhere (e.g. sync_creatives, under creative/) is found rather
