"""E2E-6: the key lifecycle observed through the served trust-root documents.

salesagent-mp53.6 (#1291) — the LIFECYCLE half of the publication instrument.
``test_jwks_publication_e2e`` (mp53.7) proved that ONE key minted through a
production path reaches the document a counterparty resolves to. This module
proves that PROVISION, ROTATION, REVOCATION and RETIREMENT each move the served
documents the way ``docs/operations/signing-key-runbook.md`` says they do.

**PROVES.** Every transition is DRIVEN through a production transport over real
HTTP — the admin ``signing-keys/create`` and ``signing-keys/<kid>/revoke``
routes, running inside the server container — and every one of them is OBSERVED
only in documents an unauthenticated counterparty can fetch over TLS:

* **publishable** — the ``kid`` set of ``/.well-known/jwks.json`` and of the
  ``adagents.json`` ``signing_keys[]`` pin (``publishable_at``);
* **active — the key this agent SIGNS with** — the ``kid`` in the protected
  header of the ``/.well-known/governance-revocations.json`` JWS. That header is
  the ONLY counterparty-fetchable signal of ``active_at``, which is what makes
  "publishable but not active" gradeable from outside at all;
* **revoked** — the ``revoked_at`` marker carried on the published JWK, plus the
  PERMANENT ``revoked_kids`` record in that same JWS payload (``all_revoked``).

The distinction ``SigningKeyRepository.all_revoked``'s docstring draws between
its three selectors — ``active_at`` (this agent SIGNS) versus ``publishable_at``
(this key is PUBLISHED) — is therefore read out of TWO DIFFERENT SERVED
DOCUMENTS, never out of a selector this test called or a row this test wrote. A key inside its revocation grace window is publishable but
not active; retirement MUST set ``revoked_at``, because closing the active window
retires a SIGNER and never a PUBLICATION.

**DOES NOT PROVE.** That any signature this agent makes verifies (E2E-3 /
salesagent-mp53.3), or that a counterparty can DISCOVER these documents from the
served capabilities block (mp53.7). Both are graded elsewhere on purpose: a
failure here must be attributable to the lifecycle, not to discovery or to the
signer.

**``not_after`` is deliberately NOT driven, and that is a fact rather than a
scope call.** No production writer ever sets ``not_after`` non-NULL:
``src.core.signing.keys.provision_signing_key`` is its only call site and it
always passes ``None`` (grep across ``src/core/signing``, ``src/admin``,
``src/routes``). So
``active_at``'s ``not_after`` branch and ``publishable_at``'s ``not_after``
blindness are unreachable in this deployment, there is no transport that could
close a window, and the absence of one is itself the strongest form of the
runbook's "retirement goes through revoke" imperative.

**Phase D moves the CLOCK, not a transport — the one exception in this module.**
``SigningSettings.grace_seconds`` has a 301s floor (``src/core/config.py`` refuses
any value at or below the published ``CACHE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS``), so an e2e test
cannot wait a grace window out. It backdates ``revoked_at`` on the live database
instead — the precedent is
``tests/integration/test_trust_root_documents.py::test_revoked_key_past_grace_disappears_from_both_documents``
— and touches no production selector. Everything else in phases A-E is a real
POST to a real route.

**One test function, five phases, one tenant.** The e2e tox env does not pass
``-p no:randomly``, so five order-dependent phase functions sharing one tenant
would be a flake bomb under pytest-randomly's shuffling; and the stack aliases
exactly one dotted TLS name, so a second tenant has nowhere to live. An
early-phase failure masking the later phases is accepted, matching the exemplar.

The four mutations this module is built to fail under, each independent, each
reverted and re-confirmed green afterwards:

1. add ``.limit(1)`` to ``SigningKeyRepository.publishable_at`` — phase B's
   both-kids assertion dies while the JWS ``kid`` still flips to kid2;
2. change ``active_at``'s ``order_by`` to ``created_at.asc()`` — the JWS ``kid``
   never flips to kid2 in phase B while the JWKS still carries both;
3. drop the ``revoked_at`` marker from ``src/core/signing/trust_root.py``'s
   ``_published_jwk`` — phase C dies;
4. make ``all_revoked`` apply the grace cutoff — phase D dies.

(1) and (2) together are what prove the JWKS and the revocation-list JWS are read
from two DIFFERENT selectors, which is the whole claim phase B makes.
