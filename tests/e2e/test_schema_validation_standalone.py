# test_valid_get_products_response removed:

# Did not exercise any sales agent behavior — purely fixture vs. upstream spec drift.
# Real schema conformance is covered by tests/unit/test_adcp_contract.py against the
# pinned adcp library version. Removed rather than skipped to satisfy the smoke-test
# TestNoSkippedTests guard.

# tests/e2e/debug_validation.py removed (#1838 review):
# A manual, non-pytest-collected debug script (run via `uv run python
# tests/e2e/debug_validation.py`) that hand-rolled an if/elif dispatch on
# get-products required-field names to build a synthetic minimal product --
# the same hand-maintained-second-copy disease PR #1868 exists to remove.
# Its debugging purpose (what does the pinned schema require, does a given
# payload validate) is already covered here (test_invalid_get_products_response,
# test_get_products_request_validation below) and by tests/unit/test_adcp_contract.py
# (the production-model contract check). The schema-derived request generator it should
# have reused instead of hand-rolling lived in the alignment suite, deleted with it
# (docs/development/building-tools.md). Had zero external references (no CI job,
# Makefile target, or doc link) — deleted rather than repaired.
