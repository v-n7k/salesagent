        field: Expected field name (e.g., "max_width", "agent_url"). Matched against the
            typed ``field`` pointer and the ``issues[].pointer`` paths — the STRUCTURED
            carriers, never the sentence.
        keyword: Expected JSON Schema keyword (e.g. "required", "type", "minLength").
            Replaces ``validation_type``, which took a PYDANTIC token: the wire now
            carries the pin's ``issues[].keyword`` vocabulary, so asserting a pydantic
            token would assert something no longer emitted. Still distinguishes "field
            missing" (``required``) from "field has the wrong type" (``type``) on the
            same field without reading prose. Note the vocabulary is coarser by design:
            ``int_parsing`` and ``string_type`` both surface as ``type``, because JSON
            Schema draws that line in one place.

    The former ``reason`` and ``message_contains`` parameters are GONE. Both pinned the
    buyer-facing sentence, which is a function of the error CODE through CODE_TABLE — so
    asserting the code and the sentence together checked the table against itself. Passing
    either is now a TypeError rather than a convention violation.
