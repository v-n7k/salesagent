    The webhook envs used to patch the transport itself — ``requests.post`` in
    one env, ``httpx.Client`` in another — which made the tests a description of
    *how* delivery is currently implemented rather than of what delivery does.
    Migrating production onto ``src.core.security.outbound_http`` deletes both of
    those symbols, so every one of those tests would have had to be rewritten as
    part of the migration, which is exactly when a rewrite is least trustworthy.

    An origin that actually serves HTTP is neutral to that choice: it answered
    ``requests.post`` before the migration and answers
    ``src.core.security.outbound_http.send`` now, and the assertions — how many
    requests arrived, with which headers, carrying which bytes — mean the same
    thing under both. That is why this landed before the migration rather than
    with it.

    The origin serves real TLS off the generated CA/leaf (the primitive from
    #1757, reused here — never a second mechanism), so it no longer needs the
    scheme hatch, which the same issue deleted entirely; the private-range
    hatch stays open for the duration of the env because the origin
    necessarily listens on loopback, which the seam refuses by default —
    opening it here is the same statement the seam's own integration tests
    make with ``set_flags(private=True)``. ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` is scoped to the
    origin's lifetime only (patched and restored alongside it, not left
    ambient for the rest of the env), pointed at the COMBINED CA bundle (system

          gap rather than a harness gap.
