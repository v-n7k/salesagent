            because that inference breaks (or, worse, silently reclassifies)
            the day ``Transport.IMPL`` is removed.

            REQUIRED and keyword-only, deliberately: a default would make
            omission mean "no wire", so a forgetful new dispatcher would send
            readers down the re-serialize path and a wire-shape assertion would
            pass green against a ``model_dump`` — the silent tautology the wire
            readers exist to raise on. Omitting it is a ``TypeError`` instead.

            Declared PER SITE, not per transport class: it is True only where
            the construction is downstream of an actual send/receive. A wire
            dispatcher's "missing config" guard constructs a result for a request
            that never left. Its catch-all ``except`` branch is a STRADDLE — it may
            fire before OR after bytes moved, and cannot tell which — so it
            declares False, because claiming a wire that may not exist is the
            failure mode that matters here: it would send a reader looking for a
            capture nothing produced.

            ``has_wire=True`` with ``wire_response is None`` on a success path
            means the env failed to STASH the wire. That is a harness bug to
            raise on loudly; it must never fall back to serializing the typed
            payload, which would assert nothing about the wire.

            SCOPE — this predicate governs the SUCCESS path only, and
            deliberately does NOT feed ``assert_wire_error``'s no-envelope
            diagnostic (which the lane in #1802 originally specified).
            The reason is concrete: a dispatcher's catch-all branch declares
            ``has_wire=False`` because it may fire before anything was sent, yet
            it can still derive a ``wire_error_envelope`` from the exception —
            ``A2ADispatcher``'s does exactly that. Wiring ``has_wire`` into that
            diagnostic would therefore report a genuine wire rejection as "no
            wire", which is worse than the message it replaces. Error-path
            wire-presence needs its own per-site declaration; that is not this
            lane's, and inventing one here would be the same identity-inference
            mistake in a new spelling.
