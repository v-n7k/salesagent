            because that inference breaks (or, worse, silently reclassifies)
            the day ``Transport.IMPL`` is removed.

            REQUIRED and keyword-only, deliberately: a default would make
            omission mean "no wire", so a forgetful new dispatcher would send
            readers down the re-serialize path and a wire-shape assertion would
            pass green against a ``model_dump`` — the silent tautology the wire
            readers exist to raise on. Omitting it is a ``TypeError`` instead.

            Declared PER SITE, not per transport class: it is True only where
            the construction is downstream of an actual send/receive. A wire
            dispatcher's "missing config" guard constructs a result for a request
            that never left. Its catch-all ``except`` branch is a STRADDLE — it may
            fire before OR after bytes moved, and cannot tell which — so it
            declares False, because claiming a wire that may not exist is the
            failure mode that matters here: it would send a reader looking for a
            capture nothing produced.

            ``has_wire=True`` with ``wire_response is None`` on a success path
            means the env failed to STASH the wire. That is a harness bug to
            raise on loudly; it must never fall back to serializing the typed
            payload, which would assert nothing about the wire.

            SCOPE — this predicate governs the SUCCESS path only, and
            deliberately does NOT feed ``assert_wire_error``'s no-envelope
            diagnostic (which the lane in #1802 originally specified).
            The reason is concrete: a dispatcher's catch-all branch declares
            ``has_wire=False`` because it may fire before anything was sent, yet
            it can still derive a ``wire_error_envelope`` from the exception —
            ``A2ADispatcher``'s does exactly that. Wiring ``has_wire`` into that
            diagnostic would therefore report a genuine wire rejection as "no
            wire", which is worse than the message it replaces. Error-path
            wire-presence needs its own per-site declaration; that is not this
            lane's, and inventing one here would be the same identity-inference
            mistake in a new spelling.

        The signing counterpart of :meth:`assert_wire_error`, and the single

        must not read the challenge header itself, for the same reason it must not
        hand-roll an error envelope.

        WHAT IS GRADED, and what deliberately is NOT. Two renderings of the one
        refusal: the challenge header here, and the response BODY in
        :meth:`_assert_challenge_envelope`, which this calls last and which is where
        ``recovery`` is graded. The claim on the header is that it is BYTE-EXACT,
        read with :func:`tests.helpers.signing.rejection_code`
        (reused, never re-parsed here: a reader that mishandles the label escaping
        reports "no rejection", which looks exactly like the mechanism not running).
        ``status_code == 401`` is NOT the assertion and never can be — a bare 401 is
        equally produced by the auth middleware rejecting first, by a 404 wearing a
        401, and by the malformed-header precheck
        (``tests/e2e/test_request_signature_required_e2e.py``). The evidence that
        this distinction is load-bearing is first-hand: in salesagent-n78j0.1.1 an
        e2e leg was forced to dispatch UNSIGNED and ``is_success`` still passed, so
        every status-shaped oracle on this path is vacuous by construction.

        NON-VACUITY, the same contract ``assert_wire_error`` carries:

        * an unknown ``code`` is refused up front against the request-family
          vocabulary production itself reads
          (:func:`tests.helpers.signing.request_signature_codes`, derived from
          ``SignatureErrorCode`` — the merged 28), so a typo or
          an invented code fails loudly instead of comparing equal to a ``None``
          that never arrives. That vocabulary is WIDER than a prefix scan of
          ``adcp.signing.errors``: the verifier also emits
          ``request_target_uri_malformed``, which carries no
          ``REQUEST_SIGNATURE_`` prefix, and a scan-derived veto made that refusal
          ungradeable. The SDK table does not carry that row at ``adcp==6.6.0``
          either — ``src/core/errors/signature_codes.py`` merges it in to reach the
          28 :class:`~src.core.errors.signature_codes.SignatureErrorCode` members,
          and that merged set is what this veto must resolve through;
        * a result with NO raw HTTP response FAILS, naming the two things that
          produce one — the env never called ``enable_request_signing()`` (so the
          leg dispatched in-process, where there is no wire and no verifier), or a
          dispatcher dropped the response. It never passes for want of evidence.

        from a finished JSON body by ``AuthChallengeResponder``, which reads the AdCP
        code out of the envelope to decide the status and the challenge in the first
        place. So an envelope always exists by the time a challenge exists, and a

        discarded the body on every 4xx — and the whole 28-code request-signature
        family went ungraded below its header on both JSON-RPC legs.

        TWO RENDERINGS, ONE REFUSAL. The challenge and the envelope are separate
