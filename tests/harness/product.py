"""ProductEnv — integration test environment for _get_products_impl.

Two envs live here: ``ProductEnv`` (everything external mocked) and
``RealResolverProductEnv`` (identical, minus the ``resolve_property_list``
patch) for the tests that must reach the real property-list resolver and the
real egress seam.

Patches: PolicyCheckService, generate_variants_for_brief,
         get_factory (ranking), resolve_property_list.
Real: ProductUoW, convert_product_model_to_schema,
      DynamicPricingService, adapter metadata, audit logger, get_db_session.

Requires: integration_db fixture (creates test PostgreSQL DB).

Usage::

    @pytest.mark.requires_db
    async def test_something(self, integration_db):
        with ProductEnv() as env:
            tenant = TenantFactory(tenant_id="t1")
            principal = PrincipalFactory(tenant=tenant, principal_id="p1")
            ProductFactory(tenant=tenant)
            PricingOptionFactory(product__tenant=tenant)

            response = await env.call_impl(brief="video ads")
            assert len(response.products) >= 1

Available mocks via env.mock:
    "policy_service"       -- PolicyCheckService class mock
    "dynamic_variants"     -- generate_variants_for_brief AsyncMock
    "ranking_factory"      -- get_factory mock (AI ranking)
    "resolve_property_list" -- resolve_property_list AsyncMock

Transport support:

    call_a2a(**kw)           -- dispatch get_products through the A2A handler

    build_rest_body(**kw)    -- POST /api/v1/products body

        Deliberately NOT an allow-list. This used to forward only
        ``(brief, brand, filters, adcp_version)`` — the fields
        ``GetProductsBody`` happens to declare — which made the REST leg
        structurally incapable of grading request-field acceptance: a test that
        sent `account` or `time_budget` had it dropped HERE, inside the harness,
        so REST always looked like it accepted every field cleanly no matter what
        production did. That is the same "a per-transport allow-list decides
        which fields exist" defect the acceptance seam exists to remove, one
        layer out, in the tests that are supposed to catch it.

        The allow-list also went stale in the other direction: it silently
        dropped ``property_list`` when the route gained it, so
        a REST case could send the field, have the harness discard it, and pass
        — grading nothing. Reading the field list off ``GetProductsBody`` would
        have fixed that one case; forwarding verbatim fixes both, because the
        harness no longer holds an opinion about which fields exist.

        The seam is the authority: the middleware publishes the wire body and
        `@accepts_spec_request_fields` carries it to the tool, which honors or
        refuses each field. The harness's only job is to put the buyer's bytes on
        the wire unaltered.
