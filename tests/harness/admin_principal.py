"""Harness for the admin PRINCIPALS surface — the routes that issue tenant credentials.

Sibling of :mod:`tests.harness.admin_accounts`, kept separate rather than bolted onto it:
that env is named for accounts and owns account seeding and cleanup, and a principals
method on it would be findable only by someone who already knew to look there.

Integration transport only, deliberately. ``AdminAccountEnv`` carries both
``integration`` and ``e2e`` because ``BR-ADMIN-ACCOUNTS.feature`` declares both and BDD
parametrizes over them. Nothing drives this env from BDD yet, so an e2e mode here would be
a transport with no caller — added when the BDD coverage that needs it is written, not
before.

Why this exists at all rather than the test reading the database itself:
``tests/unit/test_architecture_repository_pattern.py`` forbids ``get_db_session()`` in test
bodies and its allowlist only shrinks. DB access belongs in the harness, which is not
scanned — the same split ``AdminAccountEnv.get_account_from_db`` already uses.

        shrinks, so a third home is not the way to add an env. The rule is also right here
        on its own terms: this env acquires nothing that needs releasing. It constructs a
        Flask app and hands out short-lived test clients from ``with`` blocks that close
        themselves, so there is no resource for an unwind guard to protect and the
