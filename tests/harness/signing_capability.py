"""The env's ability to send a genuinely signed request.

SCOPE (salesagent-n78j0.1.1): EVERY leg — ``rest``, ``a2a``, ``mcp`` and
``e2e_rest`` — realizes a real signature over the real HTTP path. There is no
leg left that cannot: #1721 deleted the ``impl`` transport, whose whole shape was
a direct in-process call past the boundary, so "this leg has no wire, so there is
nothing to sign" no longer describes anything in the harness. What survives is
the refusal — a dispatch asked to sign with no capability established RAISES
rather than downgrading to an unsigned send, because a silent downgrade is the
exact failure mode S1 exists to remove.

TWO REALIZATIONS, ONE INTENT. ``enable_request_signing()`` means "this buyer
signs", and what that takes differs by where the verifier runs:

* in-process (``build_signing_capability``): the counterparty's resolution is
  seeded straight into the verifier's process-global ``AGENT_RESOLUTION_CACHE``
  (``src.core.signing.verifier``), because the verifier is in THIS process.
* e2e (``build_e2e_signing_capability``): the verifier is in the SERVER
  container and cannot see anything this process patches, so the key must be
  PUBLISHED — installed on the counterparty origin's control plane and reached
  by the server's own three-hop brand.json walk — and the ``agent_url`` that
  walk starts from must be on a Principal row in the SERVER's database.

The seam between them is :func:`tests.harness._realize.realize_e2e` on
``BaseTestEnv.enable_request_signing``, so a Given (or a fixture) says
``env.enable_request_signing()`` once and never learns which world it is in.

WHAT ENABLING THIS CHANGES, beyond adding a key. Owner decision D1's corollary:
once an env has this capability, BOTH its signed and its unsigned dispatches go
over the HTTP path on every leg — ``a2a`` stops calling ``on_message_send``
directly and ``mcp`` stops using FastMCP's in-memory streams. The reason is the
shape of what the verifier is handed: a signature covers things the boundary
cannot rebuild — the exact bytes, and ``@target-uri`` from ``raw_path`` — so they
are recorded by ``SignedExchangeCapture`` (``src/core/signing/capture.py``), the
app's INNERMOST ASGI middleware. A leg that never crosses the ASGI stack reaches
``serve()`` with ``exchange=None``, and ``_carries_signature`` reads that —
correctly — as "this request presented no signature". Signed and unsigned then
differ by exactly one variable, the signature, which is what makes an unsigned
dispatch a CONTROL rather than a different experiment.

WHY THIS LIVES ON THE ENV. Nothing under ``tests/bdd/steps/`` may learn that a
transport exists (salesagent-n78j0.1.1). A step says ``signed=True``; which
headers that means, and how they reach the wire, is the env's and the
dispatcher's business.

WHY A REAL TOKEN IS REQUIRED, and why no harness-injected identity can stand in
for it. Under #1721 there is no auth middleware and no signature middleware to
sidestep: every transport hands the raw headers to ``serve()``, and
``_resolve_identity`` (``src/core/resolved_identity.py``, reachable only through
``src/core/tools/_boundary.py:invoke_tool``) is the ONE reader of both
credentials — the bearer AND the RFC 9421 signature. It reads those headers
itself and no parameter accepts a pre-parsed token, so an identity the harness
hands the app has nothing to feed it. The Principal row is then read in BOTH
directions: ``token -> Principal -> agent_url`` is the key-resolution input, and
the reverse, ``verified agent_url -> Principal``, is how a signed request
carrying no bearer identifies at all. One row answers both, which is why this
capability writes to the env's OWN Principal row (:func:`attach_agent_url`)
instead of relying on the env's mock identity — one acting identity, recorded
where production reads it.

    this test's:

    1. **the ``keyid``**, because the e2e leg's positive oracle is the scraped
       ``adcp_request_signature_verified_total{operation,keyid}`` delta and the
       server's registry is cumulative for the whole session. Under a shared kid
       a window drawn around this request reads another leg's increment and
       "incremented by exactly 1" stops being a claim about this request at all.
       Same idea, same shape, as the ``uuid4()`` webhook-signing kid in
       ``_mixins.py`` (whose reason is the 60s ``(tenant_id, kid)`` provider
       cache outliving a per-test database).
    2. **the e2e counterparty SLOT**, because the server caches a resolved
       ``AgentResolution`` — the JWKS included — per ``agent_url`` for
       ``agent_resolution_ttl_seconds`` (3600 by default,
       ``src.core.signing.verifier._resolution_for``). Two capabilities sharing
       one agent url would share that cache entry: whichever walked FIRST pins
       the keyset for an hour, and every later key published at that url is
       invisible to the verifier. A per-capability slot means a per-capability
       agent url, so the cache can never be poisoned — not across xdist workers,
