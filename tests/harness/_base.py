          anything else. Read by ``_resolve_identity``.
        - ``src.core.config_loader.get_tenant_by_id`` serves ``TenantFactory.make_tenant``

          env used to hand over pre-built. Read by the resolver.
        - ``src.core.resolved_identity._load_account`` answers an active schema Account

        signature over the exact bytes this call puts on the wire, under a key
        the counterparty's own trust root publishes. The DISPATCHER realizes it,

        dispatch the caller already made — labelled with where THAT transport
        carries the config. Any further entry would be a channel this transport
        offers that no operation dispatch touches; the env would send it here.

        TODAY EVERY TRANSPORT HAS EXACTLY ONE, and the A2A story is the reason this
        seam exists at all. A2A carries two protocol-level places a buyer could
        attach a webhook — ``params.configuration.task_push_notification_config`` on
        ``SendMessage``, and the standalone ``CreateTaskPushNotificationConfig``
        method — and this function used to return the second as a location of its
        own, on the stated grounds that the handler "persists the credentials and
        returns a config id".

        It does not, and has not since #1721. AdCP defines no protocol-envelope
        registration channel — a webhook is a declared field of the AdCP request —
        so this agent declines the whole A2A push-notification capability: the agent
        card advertises ``push_notifications=False`` and all five entry points refuse
        (the four ``tasks/pushNotificationConfig/*`` handlers, and
        ``on_message_send``'s envelope check, ``_refuse_envelope_push_config``).
        A place where a buyer CANNOT hand this seller credentials is not a credential
        location, and grading it for a signature challenge asks the verifier to
        enforce signing on a channel refused above it — which it never sees.

        THE LOCATION THAT MATTERS WAS THE ONE NOT BEING SENT TO. The A2A operation
        entry pointed at the protocol envelope too, so the AdCP field — the one place
        an A2A buyer really does register a webhook, and the one the :1462-1465
        escalation reads — was graded on no transport but MCP and REST. It is graded
        on all four now. That is the opposite of the coverage trade this docstring
        used to warn about: nothing moved off a surface the seller serves.

        If a transport grows a second SERVED location it is added HERE — the scenario
        text does not change, because the scenario's claim ("a registration carrying
        credentials is refused unless signed") never mentioned a location in the first
        place.

        *config* is the ``push_notification_config`` the operation dispatch carried;
        ``None`` means the caller registered no credentials. *signed* is kept in the
        signature for the same reason: an added location must be dispatched with the
        operation's OWN realization, failure realizations included, or it would be a
        different experiment from the one the scenario set up.

        ``required_for > supported_for`` precedence.

        THREE SHAPES, and the third is the one that must not be collapsed into the

          :func:`~tests.helpers.signing.bucketed_declaration`, which names those

          required without being supported) and so leaves every other operation in
          ``none``. ``bucket="narrowed_none"`` and ``bucket="unsupported"`` are the two
          halves of ``none``, delegating to
          :func:`~tests.helpers.signing.narrowed_none` /
          :func:`~tests.helpers.signing.unsupported`; they take no operations because
          what they mean is "this surface is in no bucket";
        * ``required_for=("op",)`` — today's behaviour, unchanged;
        * NO ARGUMENT — ``{"supported": true, "required_for": []}``, and it is
          deliberately NOT ``bucket="supported"`` with no operations. That would write
          ``supported_for: []``, and a null ``supported_for`` is not an empty one: null
          means "verify wherever a signature appears" (every operation ``supported``),
          ``[]`` means every operation ``none``. Delegating would silently move
          ``tests/bdd/steps/domain/signing_enforcement.py``'s no-argument caller — the
          pinned vector 027 shape — into the bucket where nothing is verified, and its
          scenario would pass having graded a pass-through.

        The two ways of naming a bucket are mutually exclusive rather than merged: a
        call passing both would have to pick a precedence, and a silent precedence over
        two declarations is how a scenario ends up grading a posture it did not
        declare.

        The two pre-existing shapes, in the detail the third must not erase:

        * ``required_for=("op",)`` narrows ``supported_for`` to the same names
          (:func:`~tests.helpers.signing.bucketed_declaration`), so every OTHER
          operation lands in ``none`` and the composition rule
          (security.mdx :1268-1269) is what refuses an unsigned, uncredentialed call;
        * ``required_for=()`` writes ``{"supported": true, "required_for": []}`` —
          the pinned conformance vector's own ``verifier_capability``
          (``request-signing/negative/027-webhook-registration-authentication-unsigned.json``).
          ``supported_for`` is left UNSET rather than empty, which is not the same
          thing: null means "verifies wherever a signature appears" and puts every
          operation in the ``supported`` bucket, whereas ``[]`` would put them all in
          ``none`` and disable the escalation this shape exists to reach. That vector

          composition rule.

        Written through the env's OWN session, which in e2e mode is bound to the LIVE
        server's database — the one the verifier reads. ``declared_posture``'s
        ``TenantConfigUoW`` writer cannot serve both: from the runner it opens its own
        engine against ``DATABASE_URL`` (the suite database, not the server's) and is
        empirically invisible to the live server's read. Same document either way
        (:func:`~tests.helpers.signing.posture_declaration_document`), one writer.

        No restore is registered: the in-process legs get a per-test database and the
        e2e leg's live database is truncated per scenario by the BDD conftest
        (``_reset_e2e_db``), so a teardown-time DB write would have nothing to write
        through. (The release order is now the registry's — reverse acquisition, so
        patches taken after the session are stopped BEFORE it closes — but nothing
        here depends on that, precisely because no restore is registered.)

        unsigned request carrying a valid bearer is a spec-correct 200
        (security.mdx :1269). The counter's ``keyid`` label is what says the
        signature this env produced was actually verified — production records it
        verbatim from the signer the verifier resolved, and it matches the
        CAPABILITY'S OWN kid, so the count is a claim about this env's requests and

        scenario: a Then that pins ``== 1`` also rules out a leg that verified twice
        (session frames graded as operations) or zero times.

        ONE EVENT SOURCE, both legs. This used to sum ``verifier_spy`` records
        in-process while the e2e leg scraped the production counter, and those are
        DIFFERENT EVENTS: the spy wraps ``verify_request_signature``, which runs

        ``record_signature_verified`` fires only once the verifier has accepted
        (``src/core/signing/verifier.py``, at the end of ``_verify_signed``). So three of
        the four legs counted an event that PRECEDES
        the acceptance decision, and a scenario grading acceptance passed on a
        request the verifier refused. Both legs now read the same production counter
        — in-process off the shared registry, e2e over HTTP — so the oracle cannot
        disagree with itself by transport.

        The leg the signing capability needs, and strictly MORE production than

        SDK's JSON-RPC route → the integer-restoring wrapper (``src/app.py``) → the
        same ``AdCPRequestHandler`` → ``invoke_tool`` → ``_resolve_identity``, where
        the verifier runs. Identity is not fabricated here — it is resolved from the
        real bearer ``wire_request`` puts on ``Authorization``, by the same
        ``AdCPCallContextBuilder`` a live buyer would meet.

        The wire method is the a2a-sdk 1.0 native ``SendMessage``, because that is
        the only family ``/a2a`` serves (``src/app.py`` passes no
        ``enable_v0_3_compat``). This leg used to send the 0.3 ``message/send`` on
        the reasoning that ``SendMessage`` is unrepresentable in a
        ``protocol_methods_*`` bucket (the pinned capabilities schema constrains
        those with ``pattern: ^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*/[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$``) and so could only
        land in ``none``, making a signing assertion vacuous. That reasoning
        described a verifier reading the JSON-RPC METHOD off an ASGI middleware, and
        #1721 has no such middleware: the verifier runs inside ``_resolve_identity``,
        which ``invoke_tool`` reaches only once ``TOOLS[tool_name]`` resolved, so the
        operation graded against the posture is the SKILL and the ``protocol_methods_*``
        namespace is never consulted at all — ``bucket_for`` takes an AdCP operation and
        reads the AdCP buckets, so there is no argument at that boundary that COULD be
        graded against the protocol trio.

        Meanwhile ``message/send`` was not merely representable but unserved: the
        dispatcher routes by method name before any version check, answers an unknown
        name ``-32601 Method not found`` at HTTP 200, and nothing downstream runs. A
        signing scenario read that as a seller that declined to refuse.

        The leg the signing capability needs. FastMCP exposes no per-request
        header seam on its in-memory transport (``Client.call_tool`` has no
        ``headers=``), and more fundamentally that transport never touches
        ``src.app.app``, where the verifier lives — so the session is driven
        directly here: ``initialize`` → ``notifications/initialized`` →
        ``tools/call``, each POSTed through the SAME ``TestClient``-on-
        ``src.app.app`` the REST leg uses, each serialized ONCE and signed over
        exactly the bytes sent.

        Only the ``tools/call`` frame is a graded operation. ``initialize`` and
        ``notifications/initialized`` are session frames that name no AdCP operation, so
        FastMCP answers them without ever calling the boundary — no posture is read for
        them and the verifier never sees them. Signing them anyway is correct (each gets
        its own fresh nonce) and keeps "the verifier ran exactly once per dispatch" true.

        Driving the three frames by hand rather than through FastMCP's
        ``StreamableHttpTransport`` is deliberate: that client also opens a
        long-lived ``GET`` SSE stream, and httpx's ASGI transport BUFFERS the
        whole app call before returning, so the stream would never complete.
        Hand-driving also means no frame is sent that this leg did not choose.

        REMOVAL TRIGGER — **salesagent-n78j0.12** (convention:
        ``src/core/signing/_upstream/``). This is a HAND-ROLLED PROTOCOL SEQUENCE
        standing in for an SDK transport, the shape that silently drifts from the
        SDK — the same class as adcontextprotocol/adcp#6734. It is a workaround,
        not an architecture, and without a recorded trigger it becomes permanent
        by default.

        The precise upstream inconsistency, which is what n78j0.12 exists to
        verify: the SDK's ``streamablehttp_client`` DOES expose
        ``httpx_client_factory`` — a seam whose natural case is supplying
        ``httpx.ASGITransport`` for in-process testing — but
        ``handle_get_stream`` opens the standalone ``GET`` SSE UNCONDITIONALLY
        once a session id exists, with no knob, which defeats exactly that seam.

        That is report-worthy, but it is NOT filed and must not be filed from
        here: the counterfactual is unverified. n78j0.12 runs it — suppress
        ``handle_get_stream``, drive ``streamablehttp_client`` over an
        ASGI-backed factory, and see whether initialize/initialized/tools-call
        actually completes. If it does, the ticket has proof and THAT becomes
        this method's trigger; if it does not, a second blocker exists and the
        ticket would be unactionable. Scheduled after S1 closes.

        So: delete this method and dispatch through the SDK transport when
        n78j0.12 shows the ASGI-backed factory completing the handshake — or if
        an MCP/FastMCP transport appears that speaks streamable-HTTP without a
        standalone ``GET`` stream at all.

        What must NOT happen meanwhile is this sequence quietly accreting frames
        as the MCP spec evolves: if a future SDK adds or reorders a handshake
        frame, this copy will not know, and the failure will present as a
        verifier bug rather than a stale hand-roll.
        Pinned against: ``mcp`` / ``fastmcp`` as vendored at the time of writing.

        The app LIFESPAN must be running — the ``/mcp`` mount's session manager
        is started there — so a dedicated ``TestClient`` is entered for the

        ``initialize`` mints the session; a server that tracks one REFUSES any request
        before ``notifications/initialized`` confirms it ("Received request before
        initialization was complete"), so both frames are sent — and both are
        signed, because once the env can sign every byte it puts on this wire
        carries a signature.

        A SESSION IS OPTIONAL, and this mount has none. ``src/app.py`` builds the
        ``/mcp`` mount with ``stateless_http=True`` (#1721, "delete the MCP auth gate"):
        the SDK's session manager then makes a FRESH transport per request with
        ``mcp_session_id=None`` and a session that is already in
        ``InitializationState.Initialized`` (``mcp/server/streamable_http_manager.py``
        ``_handle_stateless_request`` -> ``ServerSession(stateless=True)``), so no
        ``mcp-session-id`` header comes back and nothing has to confirm the handshake.
        That is the wire's own declaration of which mount it is, which is why it is read
        from the response rather than from a flag the harness would have to keep in sync
        with production. The pre-merge mount was stateful, so this leg USED to require
        the header; requiring it against #1721's mount fails every signed MCP dispatch
        with "MCP initialize returned no mcp-session-id" on an initialize that answered
        a perfectly good 200.

        SIGNED CORRECTLY WHENEVER SIGNING IS ON AT ALL — ``bool(self._signed_dispatch)``,
        never the realization itself. These two frames are the harness's own enabling

        ``"malformed"`` realization here would 401 the ``initialize``, leave no
        ``mcp-session-id`` to read, and raise :class:`WireRefusal` carrying a 401 whose
        challenge code is IDENTICAL to the one the ``tools/call`` would have produced —
        so a scenario asserting "a malformed signature is refused" would PASS having
        graded a frame it never named, and the operation frame would never have been

        Stated once because all four legs obey the identical rules and only the
        PATH and the DTO differ. Three of those rules were learned the hard way
        and a per-leg copy would re-learn them:

        1. **Serialize ONCE, send exactly those bytes.** httpx's ``json=``
           re-serializes with its own separators, so a signature built over a
           different rendering of the same object covers different bytes than the
           wire carries and is refused as ``request_signature_digest_mismatch`` —
           a fixture bug wearing a verifier bug's clothes, the trap
           ``tests/helpers/signing.py`` warns about in its own docstring.
        2. **Once the env CAN sign, EVERY request carries the credential and the
           tenant hint, signed or not.** Otherwise ``signed=False`` is not a
           control: with no ``x-adcp-tenant`` the middleware never resolves the
           tenant whose posture was declared, falls to the ``none`` bucket and
           answers 200 — which reads as "unsigned was accepted" when in truth the
           verifier was never engaged. Measured on the first spike run, where it
           produced exactly that false green.
        3. **One identity, on the spec-canonical header** (owner decision D3/D4), and
           ONE tenant hint — the env's own, set here so no leg can send a different one.
           ``signed_headers``/``request_headers`` put the capability's token in
           ``Authorization: Bearer`` and set no ``x-adcp-auth``: the alias appears
           nowhere in the pinned 3.1 schemas, and the pinned SDK calls Bearer "the
           spec-canonical header" with the alias "purely additive"
           (``adcp/server/auth.py:311-322``). A leg that also emitted
           ``x-adcp-auth`` would win the precedence race in
           ``resolved_identity._extract_auth_token`` and silently swap the acting
           principal — signed and unsigned would then differ by more than the
           signature.

        *extra* carries whatever else the transport's own framing requires (MCP's
        ``Accept`` negotiation and its ``mcp-session-id``, for instance). It is
        merged BEFORE signing rather than added afterwards so the header set the
        signature was computed over is byte-identical to the one sent — rule 1
        applied to headers instead of to the body.

        *origin* is the scheme+authority the signature's ``@target-uri`` covers,
        and defaults to the in-process ASGI client's ``http://testserver`` — right
        for the three in-process legs and wrong for the one that leaves the
        process. The capture's ``_target_uri`` (``src/core/signing/capture.py``) rebuilds
        the authority from the ``Host`` header the proxy forwards VERBATIM, so an e2e
        caller must pass the real origin INCLUDING THE PORT or the signature
        covers a different target-uri than the verifier reconstructs and is
        refused as ``request_signature_invalid`` — a fixture bug wearing a
        verifier bug's clothes.

        *credentialed* exists for exactly one case, and it is a case rule 2 does
        not cover: grading the REFUSAL. security.mdx :1269 says an unsigned
        request carrying a valid bearer that resolves to an accepted Principal
        MUST NOT be refused for the missing signature, so a credentialed unsigned
        request is a spec-correct 200 and cannot produce a
        ``request_signature_required`` challenge to read. Only an UNACCEPTABLE
        credential — here, none at all — reaches that branch. Everything else
        about the request (the path, the body, the tenant hint) stays identical,
        so the challenge is attributable to the missing credential.

        *signed* is a REALIZATION, not a flag
        (:data:`tests.helpers.signing.SIGNATURE_REALIZATIONS`). This is the one place
        any leg signs, so it is the one place the four realizations are spelled out,
        and every leg gets all four for free:

        * ``False`` — no signature headers at all;
        * ``True`` — a real signature over exactly the bytes returned;
        * ``"malformed"`` — :data:`~tests.helpers.signing.MALFORMED_SIGNATURE_HEADERS`
          and NO real signature: both headers present, neither parseable, which is the
          verifier's step-1 pre-check failure and rejects in every bucket;
        * ``"tampered"`` — a real signature over
          :func:`~tests.helpers.signing.tampered_signing_body` of those bytes, with the
          ORIGINAL bytes returned. Well-formed headers, real crypto, and a
          ``content-digest`` that covers a body the wire does not carry: a CHECKLIST
          failure rather than a header rejection, which is the distinction the narrowed
          ``none`` bucket turns on.

        Rule 2 above holds for all four: the credential and the tenant hint are carried
        whether or not a signature is, so a realization is the ONLY variable.
        Everything else about the request is byte-identical to the ``True`` control.

        Returns ``(raw_bytes, headers)``; the caller owns the verb and the client.

        alone cannot answer it, which is why BR-RULE-209's "no real ad platform API
        calls" Then asks this as well as reading ``sandbox`` off the wire.

        In process the patched seam IS the observable: every external integration point
        is a mock, and one of them being called is production having reached it.

        Over e2e_rest those mocks live in the WRONG PROCESS -- the work happens inside the
        Docker server, nothing here is patched, and ``any(mock.called)`` is False for
        every scenario. That is the shape 97608a6fa fixed for UC-006's four mock-reading
        Thens: the env owns the answer and each branch reads the observable that exists in
        its own world. Here the live one is the audit row the server writes
        (:func:`_e2e_external_seams_exercised`).

        DECLARED ON ``BaseTestEnv``, NOT ``IntegrationEnv``, and that placement is the
        fix for a near-miss rather than a preference. NOTE: the caller that motivated it,
        the generic ``then_no_real_api_calls`` step, is DELETED -- its obligation has no
        wire observable and production violates it (see that step's removal note in
        tests/bdd/steps/generic/then_success.py), so this property currently has no
        caller. It is kept here, at the base, because the original reasoning holds for
        any future one: Five env classes in
        ``tests/harness/`` extend ``BaseTestEnv`` directly (the ``*_unit.py`` variants of
        ProductEnv / DeliveryPollEnv / WebhookEnv / CircuitBreakerEnv, plus
        MediaBuyUpdateEnv), and on ``IntegrationEnv`` this property was an
        ``AttributeError`` waiting for the first route that sent one of them through the
        step. Here every env has it.

        The e2e branch needs ``get_audit_logs``, which only ``IntegrationEnv`` can offer,
        and that asymmetry is sound: ``is_e2e`` keys on ``e2e_config``, a unit-mode env is
        built without one, so the branch that needs a session is unreachable from the envs
        that have none. If that ever stops being true the AttributeError is the right,
        loud answer.
