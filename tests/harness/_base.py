        - ``src.core.auth_utils.get_principal_from_token`` answers the env principal for the
          env principal's token, scoped to the env's tenant (or unscoped), and nothing for
          anything else. Read by ``_resolve_identity``.
        - ``src.core.config_loader.get_tenant_by_id`` serves ``TenantFactory.make_tenant``
          with this env's overrides, so ``TenantContext.load`` builds the same tenant the
          env used to hand over pre-built. Read by the resolver.
        - ``src.core.resolved_identity._load_account`` answers an active schema Account
          named by the request's reference (``tests.helpers.capture_wrapper_req.stub_account_for``),
          so a request that names an account resolves without a database and the identity

        alone cannot answer it, which is why BR-RULE-209's "no real ad platform API
        calls" Then asks this as well as reading ``sandbox`` off the wire.

        In process the patched seam IS the observable: every external integration point
        is a mock, and one of them being called is production having reached it.

        Over e2e_rest those mocks live in the WRONG PROCESS -- the work happens inside the
        Docker server, nothing here is patched, and ``any(mock.called)`` is False for
        every scenario. That is the shape 97608a6fa fixed for UC-006's four mock-reading
        Thens: the env owns the answer and each branch reads the observable that exists in
        its own world. Here the live one is the audit row the server writes

        caller. It is kept here, at the base, because the original reasoning holds for

        ``tests/harness/`` extend ``BaseTestEnv`` directly (the ``*_unit.py`` variants of
        ProductEnv / DeliveryPollEnv / WebhookEnv / CircuitBreakerEnv, plus
        MediaBuyUpdateEnv), and on ``IntegrationEnv`` this property was an
        ``AttributeError`` waiting for the first route that sent one of them through the
        step. Here every env has it.

        The e2e branch needs ``get_audit_logs``, which only ``IntegrationEnv`` can offer,
        and that asymmetry is sound: ``is_e2e`` keys on ``e2e_config``, a unit-mode env is
        built without one, so the branch that needs a session is unreachable from the envs
        that have none. If that ever stops being true the AttributeError is the right,
