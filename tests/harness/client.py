"""Transport-generic AdCP test client — one ``call()``, all transports.

One ``call()`` reaches every transport, so a scenario is written once and
graded on all of them; the per-transport shaping lives behind this seam rather
than in each env. ``AdCPTestClient.call(tool, payload,
transport)`` replaces the per-tool ``call_a2a``/``call_mcp``/
``build_rest_body``/``parse_rest_response`` quartet that today is
hand-written on every one of the 33 ``tests/harness/*.py`` env classes
(``MediaBuyDualEnv`` is the worst offender).

ADDRESS (tool -> address) is fully derived — see ``tests/harness/
address_table.py``. WRAP (payload -> transport envelope) and UNWRAP
(transport envelope -> normalized ``TransportResult``) are the only
per-transport code, and are transport-**family** functions: the same
function object serves both an in-process transport and its E2E sibling
for the reason given below, because the wire format is identical either way — only
DELIVER (how bytes reach the server) differs.

DELIVER reuses the SAME env primitives ``_run_mcp_client`` /
``_run_a2a_handler`` / ``get_rest_client`` that the per-env dispatch
methods already call — this is deliberate: those
methods own the real factory-commit / FastMCP-middleware plumbing, and
duplicating that here would violate this project's DRY
invariant for no benefit. ``client.py`` only adds the tool-name-generic
glue around them; passing ``response_cls=dict`` gets a plain dict back
from ``_run_mcp_client``/``_run_a2a_handler`` — UNWRAP (not DELIVER) then
parses that dict into ``tool_name``'s pinned SDK response model via
``spec_response_model``, so ``call()`` still does not
need a ``response_cls`` parameter — see the "typed payload" docstring note
on ``TransportResult.payload`` below for the no-pinned-model case.

THE CREDENTIAL IS A HEADERS DICT, and every leg presents it where its transport
reads headers: in-process REST sends it on the TestClient request, in-process A2A
puts it on the call context, in-process MCP hands it to ``get_http_headers``, and
the three E2E legs send it as real HTTP headers. ``env.credential()`` builds it
(``tests/harness/_base.py``); a caller that passes ``credential=`` overrides it,
and ``credential={}`` sends no headers at all. No leg carries an identity: the
real resolver builds one from the headers on every dispatch.

All three E2E transports are now implemented — ``_deliver_e2e_rest``,
``_deliver_e2e_mcp`` and ``_deliver_e2e_a2a`` below, each real HTTP through
nginx to the live Docker stack. ``RestE2EDispatcher`` and
``A2AE2EDispatcher`` (``tests/harness/dispatchers.py``) delegate to the
matching DELIVER function instead of duplicating it, so there is one
implementation per transport, not two. WRAP/UNWRAP were already written per
transport *family*, so each of these follow-ups only needed to add a
DELIVER function; ADDRESS and WRAP needed no changes.
