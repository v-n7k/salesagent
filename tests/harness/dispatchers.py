"""Dispatcher classes — one per transport.

Each dispatcher calls the env's transport-specific method and wraps the
result in a TransportResult. The env subclass provides the actual call logic;
the dispatcher only handles result wrapping and error capture.

ONE DISPATCH FORM. The MCP and A2A dispatchers call ``env.deliver_mcp`` /
``env.deliver_a2a`` — the single pair ``BaseTestEnv`` owns
(``tests/harness/_base.py``), which ``call_mcp``/``call_a2a`` delegate to as
``deliver_*(**kwargs).payload``. There is no second channel: the deprecated
raw-kwargs dispatch path was deleted once its last 18 call sites migrated, and
per-env ``call_mcp``/``call_a2a`` re-implementations are banned by
``tests/unit/test_architecture_harness_single_dispatch.py``. A scenario builds
the request model; the transport serializes it.

THE WIRE RIDES THE RETURN VALUE. Success-path wire bytes arrive on
``DeliverResult.wire_response`` and are re-emitted on
``TransportResult.wire_response``; error-path wire bytes arrive on
``TransportResult.wire_error_envelope`` from ``client.py``'s per-transport
unwraps. No dispatcher reads another object's private wire stash — that
attribute (``_last_wire_response``) is deleted, which is what makes a second
writer, and a stale wire, structurally impossible.

On error, dispatchers capture the wire error envelope (the raw two-layer dict
the buyer would see) alongside the reconstructed exception.  New tests should
assert on ``result.wire_error_envelope`` via ``assert_envelope_shape()`` — see
``tests/CLAUDE.md`` § Error Verification Policy.

Usage (internal — called by BaseTestEnv.call_via)::

    dispatcher = DISPATCHERS[Transport.A2A]
    result = dispatcher.dispatch(env, **kwargs)

# _envelope_from_adcp_error lives in transport.py, not here — both this module

#
# The MCP/A2A/REST error-path unwraps themselves are NOT re-implemented here:
# this module delegates to client.py's unwrap_mcp_error / unwrap_a2a_error /
# unwrap_rest_error, so there is one error unwrap per transport family for both
# dispatch paths (CLAUDE.md DRY invariant; remediation finding 1).
#
# Two invariants this module used to hold in its own helpers travel WITH those
# unwraps and must keep holding at their new home:
#   - ``wire_error_envelope`` carries REAL wire bytes or None — NEVER an
#     envelope the harness rebuilt from the exception it just caught. A
#     scenario asserting on that field would otherwise grade the rebuild, which
#     passes whether or not production emitted anything at all. Every dispatcher
#     below has a real wire, so None is the honest answer when nothing crossed
#     it and there is no second field to fall back to.
#   - ``has_wire`` is declared PER CONSTRUCTION SITE (required and keyword-only
#     on TransportResult), True only downstream of an actual send/receive; a
#     catch-all branch that may fire before anything was sent declares False.
