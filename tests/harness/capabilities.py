"""CapabilitiesEnv — integration test environment for _get_adcp_capabilities_impl.

Patches: adapter CLASS resolver + audit logger ONLY.
Real: get_db_session, TenantConfigUoW (publisher partners), the full response
builder (all hit real DB).

Production reads adapter default_channels/get_targeting_capabilities off a
tenant-resolved adapter CLASS (get_adapter_class_for_tenant,
src/core/helpers/adapter_helpers.py) — principal-free, identical for
anonymous and authenticated callers per INV-4 (salesagent-dn2s). The mock
below stands in for that class: production code only reads class-level
attributes/staticmethods off it, so a MagicMock works interchangeably.

The adapter/audit patches are the ONLY ones: everything the wire-shape and
pinned-schema integration tests grade (the response builder, strip_none_deep,
the real transport serializers) runs unpatched, so this env is also the
environment behind the get_adcp_capabilities rows in
tests/integration/test_wire_omission_matrix.py and
tests/integration/test_a2a_wire_integer_serialization.py.

Requires: integration_db fixture (creates test PostgreSQL DB).

Usage::

    @pytest.mark.requires_db
    def test_something(self, integration_db):
        with CapabilitiesEnv() as env:
            tenant, principal = env.setup_default_data()
            response = env.call_impl()
            assert response.supported_protocols

Available mocks via env.mock:
    "adapter"      -- get_adapter (module-level import in capabilities.py)
    "audit_logger" -- log_tool_activity (module-level import in capabilities.py)
