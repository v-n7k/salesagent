"""Tool address derivation — MCP/A2A/REST addresses read from live registration.

Builds the tool -> address map from the THREE objects production itself uses to
route real traffic: ``mcp.list_tools()`` (what a real MCP client sees),
``create_agent_card()`` (what a real A2A buyer's discovery request receives),
and ``app.routes`` (FastAPI's own dispatch table). There is no fourth,
hand-maintained list of TOOLS to keep in sync — a tool registered on any of
those three sites becomes resolvable through :data:`ADDRESS_TABLE`
automatically; a tool NOT registered on a transport raises
:class:`NoAddressForTransport` instead of silently being unreachable.

A REST route's handler function IS named after the AdCP tool it implements, so
the handler name is the tool identity and nothing translates between them. A
handler name that is not a known tool name raises
:class:`UnresolvedRestHandlerName` at table-build time — it is NEVER silently
registered under the wrong name. Tools with no REST route at all are recorded in
validated against live registration by tests (see
``tests/harness/test_address_table.py::TestRestHandlerNamesAndAbsence``). The
design this implements is stated in ``tests/harness/client.py``'s module
docstring.

Usage::

    from tests.harness.address_table import ADDRESS_TABLE
    from tests.harness.transport import Transport

    address = ADDRESS_TABLE.resolve("get_products", Transport.MCP)
    # address.name == "get_products"

    from tests.harness.address_table import NoAddressForTransport
    try:
        ADDRESS_TABLE.resolve("list_tasks", Transport.REST)
    except NoAddressForTransport:
        ...  # expected: list_tasks has no REST route

    issues with ``src.core.main`` / ``src.app`` (importing either pulls in
    the full app wiring, which some unit-test contexts must not trigger at
    module-import time).

    The three ``_index_*`` methods read production's own registration

    becomes addressable with zero map edits — inject a throwaway
    ``mcp_app``/``agent_card_factory``/``rest_app`` via the constructor
    instead of mutating the real production singletons.

    ``_index_rest`` raises :class:`UnresolvedRestHandlerName` for a REST
    handler name that doesn't match a known MCP/A2A tool name — see module
