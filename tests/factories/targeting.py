"""Pydantic factories for Targeting and the AdCP list-reference types.

Mirrors the pattern in tests/factories/format.py. These are factory-boy
factories for Pydantic models (not ORM), used in unit and integration tests
that construct Targeting objects directly.

Usage::

    from tests.factories import (
        TargetingFactory,
        PropertyListReferenceFactory,
        CollectionListReferenceFactory,
    )

    # Targeting with both list types — storyboard inventory_list_targeting shape
    targeting = TargetingFactory.build(
        property_list=PropertyListReferenceFactory.build(list_id="acme_outdoor_allowlist_v1"),
        collection_list=CollectionListReferenceFactory.build(list_id="acme_outdoor_collections_v1"),
    )
