"""Request factories: one spec-conformant baseline payload per AdCP tool.

The request-side counterpart to the ORM and response factories already in this
package. A negative-path test wants ONE bad field, and until now the only way to
get there was to hand-type a whole ``create_media_buy`` payload around it — so
every scenario re-derived its own idea of "a valid request", and each copy was
graded only by "the Pydantic constructor accepted it".

That grade is the weaker of the two contracts in play. Our DTOs and the pinned
the DTOs are GENERATED FROM the pinned schemas, so a payload the constructor
accepts is a payload the schema accepts. Measured on this tree:
``CreateMediaBuyRequest`` and ``SyncAccountsRequest`` require exactly the sets
their pinned schemas require, and ``idempotency_key`` carries the schema's
``MinLen(16)``, ``MaxLen(255)`` and ``^[A-Za-z0-9_.:-]{16,255}$`` — a
hand-written ``"test-key-1"`` is REJECTED by the constructor.

This module's docstring used to claim the opposite, and a whole suite existed to
police the gap it described. The gap had closed and nobody re-measured. What is
left is a REFUSAL rather than a suite: ``_register_tool`` will not register a
tool whose DTO does not descend from ``AdcpVersionEnvelope``, because a DTO that
does not is one from a parallel hierarchy (salesagent-fdkub). Everything a
payload does on the wire is graded by BDD.

Usage — the perturbation this module exists for::

    from tests.factories import CreateMediaBuyRequestFactory

    # the conformant baseline, as the wire dict a transport carries
    payload = CreateMediaBuyRequestFactory.payload()

    # ONE field perturbed; everything else stays conformant
    payload = CreateMediaBuyRequestFactory.payload(start_time="not-a-timestamp")

    # a required field REMOVED rather than replaced
    payload = CreateMediaBuyRequestFactory.payload(idempotency_key=OMIT)

    # a typed request object, when the caller wants DTO validation to run
    req = CreateMediaBuyRequestFactory.build(po_number="PO-1")

``payload()`` applies overrides AFTER the model dump, on purpose: a negative-path
test usually needs a value the DTO itself would reject, and routing it through
the constructor would raise in the test's own setup instead of at the boundary
under test. ``build()`` is the opposite seam — overrides go through the model, so
the caller gets DTO validation. Both exist because both are wanted; neither is
the general case.

    Not a tool factory: it binds ``src.core.schemas.creative.CreativeAssetRequest``, the
    item model ``SyncCreativesRequest.creatives`` holds and the one the runtime
    malformation gate validates every dispatched creative against
    (``GATED_ITEMS``, ``tests/factories/malformed.py``). ``_RequestFactory`` is already
    the base for sub-object payload factories — ``tests/factories/webhook.py`` binds
    three ``adcp.types`` sub-objects the same way.

    IT IS NAMED FOR THE REQUEST MODEL, and that is load-carrying. ``CreativeAssetFactory``
    (``tests/factories/creative_asset.py``) builds the RESPONSE model, and feeding a
    response-shaped creative to a request is a defect this repo has already had — see the
    note in ``make_creative_asset_request``. So does ``make_test_banner_creative``, and so
    do the per-file ``_make_creative*`` helpers. Reach for one of those by habit and the
    confusion comes back.

    Lives here rather than beside the concept in ``creative_asset.py`` because
    ``request.py`` imports ``build_assets``/``image_spec`` from that module at line 78,
    ABOVE ``_RequestFactory``: the reverse import is a cycle, reproduced as
    ``ImportError: cannot import name 'build_assets'``.

    OVERRIDE CONTRACT (all four measured against ``CreativeAssetRequest``)::

        payload()                     the conformant baseline; the pin ACCEPTS it
        payload(name="")              CHANGE a field   (still accepted — wrongness is downstream)
        payload(provenance={...})     ADD a field      (provenance/inputs/tags/status/weight
                                                        are real fields; extra="forbid" means a
                                                        TYPO is caught by the runtime gate)
        payload(assets=OMIT)          REMOVE the key entirely
        payload(format_id=None)       key PRESENT carrying null

    The last two are why ``OMIT`` matters here: the pin reports an ABSENT ``format_id``
    and a NULL ``format_id`` identically (``[type=oneOf]``), so the call site is the only
    place that can say which one the author meant — the same distinction ``malformed()``'s
    ``kind`` carries.

    A MALFORMATION IS ALWAYS A ``payload()`` OVERRIDE, NEVER A ``build()`` KWARG.
    Overrides land after ``model_dump`` and reach the wire verbatim; ``build()`` routes
    them through the model and raises in the test's own setup (measured:
    ``build(format_id=None)`` raises ``[type=oneOf]``).

    ``OMIT`` IS HONOURED AT THE TOP LEVEL ONLY. ``payload()`` loops over
    ``overrides.items()``, so ``format_id={"id": X, "agent_url": OMIT}`` writes the
    sentinel object into the nested dict verbatim. Express a nested omission by passing
    the whole nested dict. A recursive walk would have to guess how deep the caller meant.

    THE ``format_id`` DEFAULT IS FOR CTX-FREE CALLERS. It dumps through the model, so
    ``AGENT_URL`` comes back NORMALISED with a trailing slash, and its HOST is
    ``creative.adcontextprotocol.org`` while ``CreativeSyncEnv.DEFAULT_AGENT_URL`` is
    ``creative.test.example.com``. A BDD step that adopts the default therefore changes
    WHICH creative agent its payload names — a behaviour change, not a byte one — so BDD
    callers pass ``format_id={"id": ..., "agent_url": env.DEFAULT_AGENT_URL}``. Overridden
    values are passed through verbatim, which is what makes an un-normalised URL
    expressible at all.
