"""THE account seeder for tests: the ``Account`` row AND the ``AgentAccountAccess`` join.

Promoted here from ``tests/bdd/steps/generic/_account_resolution.py`` — a MOVE, unchanged
bodies. It lived under the BDD step tree only for historical reasons, while what it does
is not BDD-specific: an account a requesting agent can resolve (by explicit id or by
natural key) needs BOTH rows, because resolution is access-scoped (#1417). Everything
that seeds only an ``Account`` gets that wrong.

Two properties are the reason it works, and both are preserved verbatim:

- it seeds through factory-boy factories using the session the harness bound, so the rows
  commit into the env's database. Never reintroduce ``session.add`` here;
- it seeds ONLY what the caller asks for, so an unseeded account id still errors
  ``ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND`` by construction. Several scenarios depend on that refusal — a
  helper that helpfully seeded an extra account would silently delete it.

``ensure_tenant_principal`` deliberately did NOT come along: it takes the BDD ``ctx``
dict, so it is a step helper rather than a seeder, and it stays where the steps are.

    Ambiguity is a property of the REFERENCE, not of duplicate rows. A reference
    carrying no ``brand_id`` does not filter on one — ``_scope_natural_key`` adds
    that predicate only when the caller supplies it — so every account sharing
    the domain and operator matches it, whatever its brand_id. Each account here
    therefore gets a DISTINCT brand_id: they are separate natural keys under the
    AdCP tuple (brand.domain + brand.brand_id + operator + sandbox), and one
    partial reference matches them all. That is exactly what ACCOUNT_AMBIGUOUS
    describes, and it is a state production can still reach.

    These scenarios previously seeded rows with an IDENTICAL natural key. That
    state is now unconstructible — ``uq_accounts_natural_key`` and
    ``AccountRepository.create`` both refuse it (salesagent-0njj) — so seeding it
    would have graded behavior on data no seller can hold. The obligation is
    unchanged; only the shape of the precondition is, because the old shape
    stopped being real.

    ``owner_for_index`` decides which principal is granted access to each account,
    so a caller can make only SOME matches accessible — natural-key resolution is
    access-scoped, and inaccessible matches must not drive ambiguity (#1417).
