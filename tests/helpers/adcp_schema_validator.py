"""AdCP JSON Schema Validator — pinned to the installed SDK's schemas.

Validates requests and responses against the AdCP schemas shipped with the
pinned ``adcp`` SDK (see docs/adcp-spec-version.md for the current pin and
bump procedure) — never against the live adcontextprotocol.org registry. The
live registry serves "latest", which
drifts ahead of the repo's pin: on 2026-08-01 upstream PR adcp#6133 canonicalized
the live schemas' $ref URIs and broke remote ref resolution here overnight
with zero contract change, and before that #1308 tracked payload-vs-latest
drift. Validating against the pin makes CI deterministic and grades the same
contract production is built against. The SDK↔spec mapping is enforced by
tests/unit/test_adcp_spec_version.py.

Lives in tests/helpers/ (not tests/e2e/) because it's a cross-tier consumer:
tests/unit, tests/integration, and tests/e2e all import it, and importing an
e2e-tier module from unit/integration is backwards layering.

Schema loading and $ref resolution delegate to ``tests.helpers.pinned_schema``
— the single source of truth every pinned-schema consumer in this repo reads
through (also used by tests/unit/test_request_factory_schema_conformance.py and
the integration suite). That module resolves from the SDK's "plain" tree
(``adcp/_schemas/<major.minor>/``), not the ``bundled/`` subset: bundled only
physically ships 8 of the SDK's 16 top-level categories (no ``account/``,
``enums/``, ``governance/``, etc.) — validating a task whose schema lives in
one of the missing categories against bundled would raise "not found" even
though the schema exists and is fully valid. The plain tree is a strict
superset with equivalent (fully-resolvable) $ref behavior, so nothing is
lost by not using bundled.

Usage:
    async with AdCPSchemaValidator() as validator:
        await validator.validate_response("get-products", response_data)
