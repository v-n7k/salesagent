"""Snapshot/restore the process-global state that starting the app lifespan mutates.

WHY THIS EXISTS — a measured cross-file failure, not a hypothetical
------------------------------------------------------------------
``src.app.app`` is a module-level singleton, and its startup hook
``_install_admin_hooks``-style side effects are NOT undone by the shutdown hook.
The one that bites is the route table: ``src.app._install_admin_mounts()`` runs at
lifespan STARTUP and appends the Flask WSGI catch-all ``Mount("")``, which matches
EVERY path. Measured against the real app:

===================  ==============================  ==============================
``GET``              before any lifespan started     after one lifespan started
===================  ==============================  ==============================
``/mcp``             ``307`` -> ``/mcp/``            ``404`` text/html (Flask admin)
``/a2a``             ``405`` (route exists, POST)    ``404`` text/html (Flask admin)
===================  ==============================  ==============================

Both flips have the same cause: ``Mount("")`` returns ``Match.FULL``, so Starlette's
router never reaches its ``redirect_slashes`` fallback (which is what issued the
``/mcp`` -> ``/mcp/`` ``307``) and never falls back to its remembered ``PARTIAL``
match (which is what issued the ``/a2a`` ``405``).

Since ``tox`` runs the integration suite with ``--dist loadfile``, WHICH files share a
worker process varies between runs — so any test that starts the lifespan silently
re-shapes the app for every later file on that worker. That is how a green suite turned
red with no source change (``salesagent-66a1``): the trust-root suite asks the running
app which path a counterparty lands on, and a leaked catch-all changes the answer.

A test that starts the real lifespan therefore MUST restore. Use this context manager
rather than re-deriving the snapshot list per call site: the set of globals startup
touches is one fact, and two copies of it drift.

THE SECOND START (salesagent-n78j0.1.1)
---------------------------------------
``src.app.mcp_app`` is built ONCE at import, so the ``StreamableHTTPSessionManager``
behind the ``/mcp`` mount is a process singleton — and its ``run()`` deliberately
refuses a second call ("can only be called once per instance"). Left alone, the FIRST
test in a process that starts the lifespan silently makes the app un-startable for
every later one: measured as a ``RuntimeError`` on the second signed-MCP dispatch,
not as anything resembling its cause. Restarting is exactly the "restore what startup
mutated" contract this module already owns, so the one-shot latch is cleared here
rather than at each call site.
