"""Validate/load AdCP JSON schemas from the installed adcp SDK's pinned tree,
fully offline.

Single source of truth for schema-shape assertions in tests (e.g. the BDD
step "the response should be schema-valid against <file>") AND for the
request-factory conformance suite's schema walking
(tests/unit/test_request_factory_schema_conformance.py). Reads the SDK's own "plain"
schema tree (``adcp/_schemas/<major.minor>/``, sibling of the SDK's
``bundled/`` tree) — never the network, and never an independently vendored
snapshot: the SDK's own installed version IS the pin (moves with
pyproject.toml's ``adcp`` version), so there is exactly one upstream pin for
every consumer that reads through this module (this module previously read
a separately vendored, independently pinned fixture tree that had already
drifted a full spec-minor behind).

The plain tree (not ``bundled/``) is deliberately the source: ``bundled/``
only physically ships 8 of the SDK's 16 top-level schema categories (no
``account/``, ``enums/``, ``governance/``, etc.) — it is a strict subset of
the plain tree, not a superset, despite being individually self-contained
per file. The plain tree's schemas use relative ``$ref``s (``../core/x.json``,
resolved against the referring file's own directory) instead of bundled's
pre-inlined local anchors; this module resolves those relative refs by
stamping every loaded schema with its own ``file://`` URI (``path.as_uri()``)
before handing it to ``jsonschema``/``referencing``. ``file://`` is a real
scheme that ``referencing``'s ``urljoin``-based resolution handles natively,
and it maps back to a path with no invented naming convention in between.

The pure resolution primitives (``schema_root``, ``normalize_ref``, ``load``,
``PinnedSchemaError``, and their private helpers) live in
``tests/helpers/adcp_pinned_schema.py`` — a stdlib-only module, so there is
exactly ONE resolution implementation and never a second copy. This module
re-exports every one of those names and
adds on top the jsonschema-validation surfaces plus the pinned-enum readers
that the test-side oracles grade against:

- ``validator_for(ref)`` — a ready-to-use ``Draft7Validator`` with full
  ``$ref`` resolution wired, for validating a payload against a schema
  (``validate_against_pinned_schema`` is the convenience wrapper most
  callers want).
- ``load(ref)`` — re-exported from ``tests/helpers/adcp_pinned_schema`` — a
  single schema's raw dict, ``$ref``s left as-is, for callers that WALK the
  schema tree themselves (the alignment suite's synthetic-example
  generator) rather than validating a concrete payload. Callers that want
  to follow the refs they find should use ``load_canonicalized``, which
  rewrites them into the root-relative form ``load`` itself accepts.
- ``recovery_by_code()`` — the normative ``error-code.json`` ``enumMetadata``
  ``{code: recovery}`` map, the ONE test-side reader of that block (see its
  own docstring for why it lives here rather than in each consumer).
- ``auth_scheme_values()`` — the pinned ``enums/auth-scheme.json`` ``enum``,
  the ONE test-side reader of that enum, for the same reason.

    classification embedded in that prose is normative and MUST match the value
