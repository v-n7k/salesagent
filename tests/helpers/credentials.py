"""The one producer of the credential headers a test presents to this seller.

WHY HERE AND NOT IN tests/harness/. Building a request credential is what every suite
does -- unit, integration, admin, e2e, BDD -- and the harness env is one consumer among
many, not the owner. A second reason keeps it out of that package:
``test_guards_no_adhoc_testclient_bypass`` reads ANY ``tests.harness`` import as "this
test has the harness available", so a test that imports one pure function from there is
required to route its REST calls through the harness too.

Enforced by ``.ast-grep/rules/test-credential-header-single-producer.yml``, which
``make quality-ci`` runs over ``tests/``; graded by
``tests/unit/test_ast_grep_credential_header_ban.py``.

    """THE producer: the headers a test presents to this seller, from plain values.

    Every dispatcher, fixture, builder and per-test literal in ``tests/`` builds its
    credential headers here, so a change in what production reads off the wire is one
    edit. Enforced by ``.ast-grep/rules/test-credential-header-single-producer.yml``,
    which ``make quality-ci`` runs; graded by
    ``tests/unit/test_ast_grep_credential_header_ban.py``.

    Production reads the credential from ``Authorization: Bearer`` on every transport,
    which is why one function serves them all. The ``x-adcp-auth`` alias this used to
    send is not read: pinned 3.1.1 ``L2/authentication.mdx:71`` says the credential MUST
    ride ``Authorization`` and sellers MUST NOT require non-canonical aliases. A caller
    sending the alias presents nothing the resolver can see, which surfaces as
    AUTH_MISSING rather than as a header error.

    Each header is OMITTED when its value is absent, never sent empty: ``token=None``
    dispatches unauthenticated, so the resolver returns the real AUTH_MISSING rejection
    instead of one for a malformed credential.

    ``tenant`` is the ``x-adcp-tenant`` value: the tenant_id on every leg. ``_detect_tenant``
    (``src/core/resolved_identity.py``) tries it as a subdomain first and then takes it
    as the literal id, so the id resolves whether or not a subdomain row matches it.
    ``BaseTestEnv.credential`` (``tests/harness/_base.py``) is the harness's call of this
    function; a test outside the harness calls it directly.
