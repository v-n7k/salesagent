"""Seeding and boundary helpers for tests that drive a media-buy approval for real.

An admin approval route calls ``execute_approved_media_buy``, which is the sole
post-adapter writer of the media-buy row. A test that patches that callee has
removed the only writer, so it can no longer assert anything about what the
approval persisted. The one thing worth patching is the AD-SERVER boundary
(``ADAPTER_BOUNDARY``), which leaves the callee, both units of work, and every
commit running for real.

Getting a buy through that callee needs more than a ``MediaBuyFactory`` row — see
``seed_pending_buy`` — and getting a creative through the asset gate needs more
than a ``CreativeFactory`` row — see ``uploadable_creative``. Both are here rather
than in one test module because the workflows, operations and creatives approval
routes all need them.
