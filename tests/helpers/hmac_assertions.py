"""Grading for HMAC-SHA256 webhook signatures, over the RAW bytes received.

Recomputing over the origin's captured ``.body`` (rather than a fresh
serialization of the payload dict) is the whole point: a recompute from the
dict uses whatever serialization formula the caller happens to pick, which
can silently agree with a sender that signed one serialization and
transmitted another — the exact defect #1441 fixed. Several test
files need to grade that same signed-bytes-equal-wire-bytes property, so it
lives here once instead of six near-identical copies drifting apart.
