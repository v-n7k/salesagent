"""Shared helpers for the signing test modules (#1291).

Three groups:

* **A2 key provisioning** (``salesagent-z6nr.8``) — build the tenant-scoped
  repository off the harness session, provision a key through production, and
  resolve a provider through production.
* **The B1 verifier seams** (``salesagent-z6nr.14`` step 2, review finding LOW-1)
  — the DECLARATION substitute, the counterparty-key seed, the verifier spy, the
  wire rejection-code reader and the Prometheus counter readers. These were
  defined inside ``tests/integration/test_request_signature_middleware.py`` and
  imported ACROSS test modules by two siblings (and now a third, the B3
  conformance run) — the duplication class the DRY invariant and
  ``check_code_duplication.py`` exist to stop. One definition, here.
* **The verifier kill switch** (:func:`verifier_disabled` and its monkeypatch-scoped
  wrapper :func:`inbound_verifier_disabled`), which exists because the verifier's
  DEFAULT is on. A seller that runs the verifier is a seller that "supports request
  signing", and security.mdx @ v3.1.1 :1465 then makes a 9421 signature MANDATORY on
  any request carrying webhook credentials — ``push_notification_config.authentication``
  or ``accounts[].notification_configs[].authentication`` — regardless of
  ``required_for`` membership. That is a real production obligation with its own tests.

  It is not, however, the obligation a test about SERIALIZATION or FORWARDING is
  grading, and such a test that happens to carry an ``authentication`` block would
  otherwise be refused before its subject ran. Those tests say so explicitly, by
  entering the kill switch, rather than quietly dropping the block their assertions
  are about.

Deliberately thin: these forward to production entry points and add nothing.
Anything that decides or asserts belongs in the test, not here.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These were module constants of the B1 middleware suite that the B4 operations,
# A5 revocation and B3 conformance suites then imported ACROSS test modules (or
# re-declared verbatim). Both shapes are the same defect: a name whose home is a
# ``test_*.py`` module has no importable home at all. One definition, here.

#: The counterparty as the Principal row carries it. ``agent_url`` is the ONLY
#: legitimate source for a counterparty's identity (security.mdx forbids taking
#: it from a header, a body field or any other self-assertion), and the
#: verifier keys :data:`AGENT_RESOLUTION_CACHE` on exactly this value.
COUNTERPARTY_AGENT_URL = "https://buyer.example.com/a2a"

#: The ``keyid`` the counterparty signs under.
COUNTERPARTY_KID = "buyer-request-signing-1"

#: The counterparty as a REGISTERED entry of
#: :attr:`~src.core.config.SigningSettings.counterparty_registry` carries it (#1291 B4).
#: Deliberately different from :data:`COUNTERPARTY_AGENT_URL` and its origin: the two
#: resolution paths must be distinguishable at the assertion, so a test can say WHICH
#: one supplied the key rather than only that some key was found.
REGISTRY_AGENT_URL = "https://test-kit.example.com/a2a"

#: An ``agent_url`` whose brand.json walk FAILS, deterministically and with no network.
#:
#: The SDK resolves and validates the host SYNCHRONOUSLY before any socket is opened
#: (``adcp/signing/ip_pinned_transport.py`` ``resolve_and_validate_host`` via
#: ``build_async_ip_pinned_transport``), so a loopback authority is refused as a
#: reserved range and ``async_resolve_agent`` raises ``AgentResolverError
#: ("capabilities_unreachable")`` in microseconds. That is a REAL failure of the real
#: walk — not a patched resolver — which is what a test grading "the walk failed" needs
#: if it is not to be a mock asserting on itself. A public-looking hostname would
#: instead put a DNS lookup in the test's critical path.
UNRESOLVABLE_AGENT_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:1/a2a"

#: The origin the in-process ASGI client dials. ``httpx``'s ASGI transport defaults to
#: ``http://testserver``, and the signature covers ``@target-uri``, so a request signed
#: against any other origin fails on its merits before the behavior under test is reached.
WIRE_ORIGIN = "http://testserver"

    """The scheme+authority of *url* — what a signature's ``@target-uri`` covers.

    The PORT is the whole reason this is a function and not a slice: ``_target_uri``
    (``src/core/signing/capture.py``) rebuilds the authority from
    the ``Host`` header the proxy forwards verbatim, so a caller that signs against a
    portless origin covers a different ``@target-uri`` than the verifier reconstructs
    and is refused as ``request_signature_invalid``. One definition — shared by the
    e2e suite (``tests/e2e/_signing_e2e.origin``) and the harness's e2e_rest dispatch

SIGNING_PRINCIPAL_ID = "sig_principal"

#: The seller's own host, DOTTED so ``canonical_agent_url`` derives ``https://`` for it.

#: Load-bearing since #1291 D1: a stored ``request_signing`` declaration with any
#: non-empty bucket fires the pinned ``identity.brand_json_url`` ``required_when``, and
#: the pin fixes that pointer to ``^https://``. ``_get_protocol_for_domain``
#: deliberately derives ``http`` for localhost and single-label hosts, so on the default
#: integration host every declaration :func:`declared_posture` writes would be REFUSED —
#: and the suites would grade the refusal path while reading like they graded the
#: declared one. Requests still reach this tenant by the ``x-adcp-tenant`` header
#: (:func:`request_headers`), so the host is identity, not routing.
SIGNING_AGENT_HOST = "seller-signing.example.com"

#: The ``get_adcp_capabilities`` AdCP surface. Auth-optional, so any 401 seen on it came
#: from the verifier and not from the route's own auth dependency — which is why the
#: header-presence and header-shape cases are graded here.
#:
#: IT TAKES A BODY, like every AdCP surface does. This was ``CAPABILITIES_ADCP_PATH`` and its
#: docstring called it "an AdCP surface path with no request body", which was true only
#: while ``GET /api/v1/capabilities`` existed; #1721 deleted that route (6b51acca8) and
#: every surface is now a POST tool whose DTO requires a body. The name outlived the thing
#: it named, and it cost something real: it told an author there was a cheap bodiless way
#: to probe the header branches, and the probe that followed carried TWO independent faults
#: — a malformed signature AND a missing body — so it could grade neither. A request with
#: no body is refused at ``validated_request`` before any credential is read, which is the
#: correct and deliberate ordering (``src/core/tools/_boundary.py``): structural validation
#: is the cheapest check and a structurally invalid request should not buy crypto or a
#: three-hop discovery walk. That is the same defect class this project filed upstream as
#: adcontextprotocol/adcp#7567 — a probe carrying two faults grades neither — written into
#: our own suite.
CAPABILITIES_ADCP_PATH = "/api/v1/capabilities"

#: A SECOND body-carrying AdCP surface, distinct from :data:`CAPABILITIES_ADCP_PATH` only
#: in being a different operation. Needed by any case whose realization is a
#: ``content-digest`` mismatch: :func:`tampered_signing_body` refuses an empty body,
#: because signing and sending identical zero bytes is ACCEPTED.
#:
#: This was named for a collision that no longer exists. On the old architecture it
#: was "the body-rewriter collision site (R-H2)": ``normalize_request_params``
#: translated the deprecated ``account_id`` → ``account`` (``src/core/request_compat.py``)
#: and ``RestCompatMiddleware`` (``src/routes/rest_compat_middleware.py``) then rewrote
#: the body downstream of the verifier, so the route graded "the verifier saw the WIRE
#: bytes, not the rewrite". BOTH modules are deleted on this architecture — nothing
#: rewrites a request body between the socket and the signature subject
#: (``src/core/signing/capture.py`` captures the bytes as read) — so the collision is
#: structurally absent rather than untested. What remains, and what callers use, is a
#: real body-carrying route.
REWRITTEN_ADCP_PATH = "/api/v1/media-buys"

#: Metric names from B1 plan step 6. ``code`` collapses to ``"other"`` outside the
#: 27 spec strings; ``keyid`` is the real value only after step-7 resolution.
VERIFIED_METRIC = "adcp_request_signature_verified_total"
FAILED_METRIC = "adcp_request_signature_failed_total"

#: The third counter of the same family: ``reason="absent"`` (no signature headers)
#: or ``reason="ignored"`` (headers present, the posture buckets the operation as
#: ``none``, nothing verified). Named here beside its two siblings because the
#: ``ignored`` arm is the one observable that distinguishes "the verifier passed
#: this request through and counted it" from "the verifier stopped counting" —
#: the two look identical on the wire.
UNSIGNED_METRIC = "adcp_request_unsigned_total"

#: The AdCP operations the B1 shadow-mode ladder invokes, and which the A5
#: revocation suite declares alongside it so both bucket the same two names.
#:
#: Two names rather than one, because the ladder runs on two routes:
#: ``/api/v1/capabilities`` (both verbs) is ``get_adcp_capabilities`` and POST
#: ``/api/v1/media-buys`` is ``create_media_buy``. Each test exercises exactly one
#: of them and :func:`bucketed_declaration` puts BOTH in the bucket under test, so

    That module is the merge-correct source, and it is STRICTLY better than the

    the SDK omits at ``adcp==6.6.0``, so the one-row correction below is no longer
    something this helper has to know about separately. The members are ``StrEnum``,

    A PREFIX SCAN OF ``adcp.signing.errors`` IS SUCH A COPY, and it was what stood

    cosmetic: ``TransportResult.assert_signature_challenge``
    (``tests/harness/transport.py``) refuses an unknown code UP FRONT, before it
    reads the wire at all, so the harness vetoed a code production sends and no
    scenario could grade that refusal.

    """Run the SDK's verifier over *signed* the way the PINNED spec defines it.

    *signed* is one outbound POST as the receiving socket saw it — the ``url`` a
    receiver reconstructs from its own wire, the headers it received, the bytes it
    read. Three graders need exactly this call: the C2 proof-of-control challenge
    (in-process, ``tests/integration/test_notification_proof_challenge.py``), the
    E2E-3 delivery webhook (``tests/e2e/test_webhook_signature_e2e.py``), and the
    BR-UC-004 9421 sibling scenario (``tests/bdd/steps/domain/uc004_delivery.py``,
    #1291 z6nr.31). One definition, here — a verifier that drifted between them would
    let one surface be graded more weakly than the other.

    ``verify_webhook_signature`` is the SDK's webhook entry point and it is the right
    machinery — the whole checklist, the tag pin, the required components, the digest
    policy, the alg allowlist, the step-6 component precheck, and the request->webhook
    error retag. It is called here through the request verifier plus the SAME two
    private helpers ``verify_webhook_signature`` itself calls
    (``adcp.signing.webhook_verifier._precheck_webhook_has_required_components``,
    ``._retag_to_webhook``) rather than a hand-copied reimplementation, because the SDK
    diverges from the pin on exactly ONE value and ``WebhookVerifyOptions`` gives no way
    to override it:

    security.mdx @ v3.1.1 :1426 — *"Webhooks are signed with the agent's ``adcp_use:
    "request-signing"`` key; there is no separate webhook key purpose. Domain separation
    between requests and webhooks is carried by the signature ``tag`` … not by the key
    purpose."* Its required-JWK table pins ``adcp_use`` to ``"request-signing"``, :955
    repeats it ("webhooks do not need their own purpose"), and :1438 makes
    ``"webhook-signing"`` DEPRECATED — verifiers "MUST still accept it for backward
    compatibility", while "new signers SHOULD publish and sign with ``"request-signing"``
    keys only". Step 8 (:1478) and the taxonomy row (:1560) both say the accept-set is
    exactly ``{"request-signing", "webhook-signing"}`` — never a single value in either
    direction.

    The SDK inverts that: ``verify_webhook_signature`` builds its options with
    ``expected_adcp_use=ADCP_USE_WEBHOOK``, so it accepts ONLY the deprecated value and
    REJECTS the one the spec mandates for new signers
    (``webhook_signature_key_purpose_invalid``). Filed upstream:
    https://github.com/adcontextprotocol/adcp-client-python/issues/1018 (FIXME(#1291)).
    The divergence itself is also pinned locally by
    ``TestChallengeIsSignedAndVerifiable.test_the_sdk_webhook_verifier_diverges_from_the_pin``
    so it becomes a loud failure the moment the SDK is fixed and this substitution can go;
    the accept-SET breadth graded here (``tests/unit/test_conformant_receiver_key_purpose.py``)
    is a SEPARATE, longer-lived obligation that outlives that fix — the spec's requirement,
    not a note about the SDK's bug.

    Verifying with the accept-set is therefore what a CONFORMANT receiver does: attempt
    ``"request-signing"`` first (:1426's canonical value); on a refusal caused SPECIFICALLY
    by the ``adcp_use`` mismatch, retry ONCE with ``"webhook-signing"``. Any other step-8
    refusal (``use``, ``key_ops``, or algorithm) is reported as itself, never blurred into
    a purpose complaint by a retry that re-runs the whole check under a second purpose —
    the SDK's ``_check_key_purpose`` gives no code finer than
    ``request_signature_key_purpose_invalid`` for any of its four conditions, so the
    ``"adcp_use"`` substring in the exception's own message is the only signal available to
    tell them apart.

    Everything except the widened accept-set is copied from the SDK's own construction, so
    this cannot drift into a weaker check than the SDK performs.

    Nothing here reaches into ``src``: the decision is made by SDK code over the wire
    bytes and a JWKS document, which is what lets an e2e caller claim its VERIFY path
    holds no production import.
