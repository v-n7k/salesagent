"""Loader + execution plan for the AdCP request-signing conformance vectors.

#1291 B3 (``salesagent-z6nr.14``). Two things live here, and nothing else:

1. **The loader** — reads the vendored, sha256-pinned snapshot under
   ``tests/fixtures/adcp_conformance_vectors/3.1.1/request-signing/`` offline.
   Same shape as :mod:`tests.helpers.pinned_schema`: a missing file is a HARD
   ``AssertionError``, never a skip, so a re-vendor that drops a vector cannot
   quietly shrink the graded set.

2. **The per-vector execution plan** (:data:`TRANSPLANT`) — OUR data about how
   each vector is driven at L2, deliberately NOT inside the vendored tree: that
   tree is upstream-owned and byte-pinned, and mixing our plan into it would put
   our decisions behind the drift guard's hashes.

Why a transplant is needed at all (decision D-B3-1, settled — do not relitigate):
``src.core.signing.capture.ADCP_SURFACE_PREFIXES = ("/mcp", "/a2a", "/api/v1")`` gates
the CAPTURE middleware, and the vectors address ``/adcp/<operation>``. Sent verbatim
they carry no ``HttpExchange``, so ``SignatureSubject.exchange`` is ``None``, nothing is
verifiable, and all 40 would "pass" having graded nothing. Serving ``/adcp/*`` is a
protocol-surface decision, not a test-harness one, so it belongs to B4
(``salesagent-z6nr.15``), which grades the URL space black-box.

There is no verifier MIDDLEWARE on this architecture. ``capture.py`` "DECIDES NOTHING":
it records the message bytes, ``@method`` and the raw-path ``@target-uri`` on the ASGI
scope, and the ONE verifier call is
:func:`src.core.signing.verifier.verify_inbound_signature`, reached from
``src.core.resolved_identity._resolve_identity``, which only
``src.core.tools._boundary.invoke_tool`` calls. A request therefore reaches the verifier
iff it dispatches a registry tool — see :attr:`VectorPlan.route_named`.

The transplant rule is MECHANICAL and has exactly one form — see
:func:`transplant_url`. ``wire_url`` is nevertheless spelled out per row so a typo
in either the rule or a row is a loud failure
(``test_signing_conformance_plan.py::test_wire_url_matches_the_mechanical_rule``),
not a silently different request.

The BODY is transplanted for the same reason, and only since #1721
-------------------------------------------------------------------
``src.core.tools._boundary.serve`` computes ``validated_request(...)`` BEFORE it calls
``invoke_tool(...)``, and ``invoke_tool`` is what resolves the identity and therefore
what reaches the verifier. A body the dispatched tool's DTO refuses is answered
``INVALID_REQUEST`` (400) with the checklist never running — so a vector body carried
verbatim onto ``create_media_buy`` grades nothing at all, exactly as a verbatim
``/adcp/...`` URL grades nothing. The vectors were authored against the pre-#1721
ordering, where the verifier was an ASGI middleware that ran ahead of every DTO.

The body transplant is therefore the same kind of edit as the URL one and is bounded
the same way: :func:`transplant_body` moves the body onto the transplanted operation
and preserves every part of it that the vector GRADES. What a vector grades about its
body at L2 is exactly two things, and both survive:

* its ``Content-Digest`` — recomputed only where the vector's own digest was a TRUTHFUL
  digest of its own body AND the row is re-signed anyway (:func:`recomputes_digest`,
  ``positive/002`` alone). A digest the vector deliberately FALSIFIED stays falsified,
  which is what keeps ``negative/010`` a digest mismatch, and a row that is not
  re-signed keeps every header byte, which is what keeps ``017``/``020``'s placeholder
  signature working as the step-ordering canary.
* whether the request REGISTERS webhook credentials — ``negative/027``'s whole subject,
  read by ``src.core.signing.webhook_credentials.registers_webhook_credentials`` off
  the VALIDATED request, so it only exists at all if the body validates.

A row that names no route (:attr:`VectorPlan.route_named` is False) keeps its body
VERBATIM: it 404s in the router before any DTO sees it, and ``negative/028``'s JSON-RPC
envelope is the thing that puts it in the protocol-method namespace.
