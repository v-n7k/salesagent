"""BDD binding for the locally-added request-signature enforcement feature.

Grades the inbound-signing obligations across every wire transport the suite
parametrizes (a2a / mcp / rest, plus e2e_rest when the live stack is up) —
salesagent-n78j0.1.3. Every one of those is a REAL wire path; there is no in-process
transport to fall back to, which is the whole point of binding the obligations here.
The obligations and their spec citations live in the feature file; what belongs HERE
is why they are bound as a file of their own:

* they are CROSS-transport claims, so grading them inside a per-transport module is
  the exact failure (SF-5) the epic exists to undo;
* they run on ``sync_creatives`` because it is the lightest AdCP operation that
  accepts a ``push_notification_config`` on all three transports (the escalation's
  own trigger, security.mdx :1462-1465) — the operation is scenery, the enforcement
  ladder is the subject;
* one file, one env, one operation, and every scenario differing from a neighbour
  by exactly one variable, so a difference in outcome is attributable to the
  variable. (The file was written for three scenarios and has since grown the
  malformed-signature outline and the three posture-bucket rows; the one-variable
  rule holds across all of them.)
