"""Emit the scenario-liveness artifact from a real BDD run.

``storyboard_coverage_map.covered_storyboards`` (and the check index built on
top of it) derives "covered" from tag presence plus the ``@source``
footer alone. Nothing in that path asks whether the scenario actually RUNS —
and ``tests/bdd/conftest.py``'s own auto-xfail hook converts
``StepDefinitionNotFoundError`` into ``xfail``, so a ``@storyboard-v3.1``-tagged
scenario with zero bound step definitions counts as coverage forever. This
module is the fix for the measurement, not the report: it emits, from a real
``pytest tests/bdd`` invocation, one liveness record per tagged scenario, and
each record carries the three facts the parent finding names:

* ``steps_bound`` — measured, not inferred. Computed by walking every step of
  the scenario through pytest-bdd's own ``get_step_function`` (the exact
  function ``_execute_scenario`` uses to decide whether to raise
  ``StepDefinitionNotFoundError``) *before* any step body runs, via the
  ``pytest_bdd_before_scenario`` hook. This checks every step, not just the
  first one pytest-bdd would fail on — a scenario whose first three steps are
  bound and fourth is not still reports ``steps_bound=False`` with the
  unbound step named, instead of silently stopping at the first failure the
  way a live run's exception would.
* ``harness_wired`` — a best-effort signal for THIS module only, derived from
  the same auto-xfail reason text conftest.py already produces verbatim (e.g.
  ``"No harness wired for {uc}"``, ``"UC-004 harness not yet wired for type:
  ..."``). ``None`` when the scenario's steps aren't bound at all (the
  question is unreached: a step that doesn't even parse never gets to the
  harness-selection branch). ``scripts/audit/scenario_liveness_join.py``
  does not trust this field — it replaces it with a
  proper data lookup against the declarative ``ENV_ROUTES`` registry (no
  reason-text matching), which is why this module's own ``harness_wired`` is
  documented as best-effort rather than promoted further here: any UC not yet
  a row in ``ENV_ROUTES`` should read as not-wired downstream, not as
  whatever this reason-text heuristic happens to guess.
* ``ledgered`` — True when the observation's reason falls into neither of the
  above two buckets (an explicit, curated ``xfail`` marker for a known
  production/spec gap), or the scenario's e2e_rest nodeid appears in
  ``tests/bdd/e2e_rest_known_failures.txt``. ``scripts/audit/scenario_liveness_join.py``
  reads this field straight through and combines it with the conformance-ledger
  ``measured`` column ``storyboard_check_index.CheckRecord`` already carries
  (the third ledger, via ``scripts/audit/ledger.py``'s L0 loaders) to flag
  graduation candidates — this module only reads the one ledger BDD itself
  already loads.

Emits ``test-results/bdd_scenario_liveness.json`` (or
``$BDD_LIVENESS_ARTIFACT``) at session end — a per-run artifact, not a
checked-in one; test-results/ is gitignored. A run that never collects any
``@storyboard-v3.1``-tagged scenario (e.g. ``-k`` narrowed to something else)
writes an artifact with an empty ``scenarios`` list rather than skipping the
write — "the artifact didn't run this session" must be visible in the file
itself, not inferred from the file's absence.
