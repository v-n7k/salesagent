Feature: BR-UC-023 Sync Product Catalogs
  As a Buyer
  I want to manage product catalog feeds on a seller account
  So that I can upload, update, discover, and delete catalogs for catalog-based advertising campaigns

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer has synced catalogs and received per-catalog action results (created, updated, unchanged, failed, deleted)
  #   POST-S2: Buyer can discover all catalogs on an account without modification (discovery-only mode)
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows the platform-assigned ID, item counts, and item review status for each catalog
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows about per-catalog warnings, errors, and item-level issues
  #   POST-S5: Buyer has previewed what changes would be made without applying them (dry-run mode)
  #   POST-S6: Buyer has purged buyer-managed catalogs not in the request when delete_missing is true
  #   POST-S7: Application context from the request is echoed unchanged in the response
  #   POST-S8: For async operations, Buyer receives progress updates and knows when input is required
  #   POST-S9: For queued operations, Buyer receives a submitted task envelope (status=submitted, task_id) resolvable via tasks/get or webhook
  #   POST-S10: A retried sync with the same idempotency_key does not double-apply changes or re-fire side effects (at-most-once)
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on complete operation failure
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what failed and the specific error code with recovery classification
  #   POST-F3: Application context is still echoed when possible
  #   POST-F4: Individual catalog failures do not prevent other catalogs from being processed (partial success)
  #
  # Rules: BR-RULE-043 (context echo), BR-RULE-132 (capability gate), BR-RULE-172 (upsert semantics),

  #   BR-RULE-176 (selectors/attribution), BR-RULE-177 (response structure), BR-RULE-178 (async lifecycle),

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the Buyer is authenticated with a valid principal_id
    And the seller has declared catalog_management capability as true
    And the account reference resolves to a valid account

  @T-UC-023-ext-j-submitted @extension @ext-j @async @post-s8
  Scenario: Async lifecycle -- submitted acknowledgment for large sync
    Given the sync_catalogs operation requires async processing
    When the Buyer Agent sends a sync_catalogs request with 50 catalogs
    Then the response is a SyncCatalogsAsyncResponseSubmitted
    And the submitted response includes the request context
    And the submitted response has status "submitted"
    And the submitted response includes a task_id
    # POST-S8: Buyer receives submitted acknowledgment

  @T-UC-023-ext-j-working @extension @ext-j @async @post-s8
  Scenario: Async lifecycle -- working progress with catalog and item counts
    Given the sync_catalogs operation is in progress
    When the Buyer Agent receives an async progress update
    Then the response is a SyncCatalogsAsyncResponseWorking
    And the working response includes percentage between 0 and 100
    And the working response may include catalogs_processed and catalogs_total
    And the working response may include items_processed and items_total
    And the working response may include current_step description

  @T-UC-023-ext-j-input @extension @ext-j @async @post-s8
  Scenario Outline: Async lifecycle -- input required with reason <reason>
    Given the sync_catalogs operation is paused waiting for buyer input
    When the Buyer Agent receives an input-required notification with reason "<reason>"
    Then the response is a SyncCatalogsAsyncResponseInputRequired
    And the input-required response has reason "<reason>"
    And the response includes the request context
    # POST-S8: Buyer knows operation is paused and why
    # BR-RULE-178 INV-3, INV-5: input-required with valid reason code

    Examples:

  @T-UC-023-ext-j-webhook @extension @ext-j @async @post-s8
  Scenario: Async lifecycle -- push notification config enables webhook delivery
    Given the Buyer Agent provides a push_notification_config with webhook URL
    When the Buyer Agent sends a sync_catalogs request that requires async processing
    Then the system sends async updates via the configured webhook URL
    And the webhook notification includes the task status
    # BR-RULE-178 INV-6: webhook sent on completion or input-required

  @T-UC-023-ext-k @extension @ext-k @async @post-s9
  Scenario: Submitted async task -- queued sync returns task handle with results deferred
    Given the sync_catalogs operation must be processed asynchronously
    When the Buyer Agent sends a sync_catalogs request that is queued for batch ingestion
    Then the response is a SyncCatalogsSubmitted with status "submitted"
    And the submitted response includes a task_id
    And the submitted response does not contain a catalogs array
    And the request context is echoed in the response
    And the Buyer Agent can resolve final per-catalog results via tasks/get with the task_id
    # POST-S9: submitted task envelope; per-catalog results resolved via tasks/get or webhook
    # BR-RULE-177 INV-7: queued -> status submitted + task_id, per-result data deferred

  @T-UC-023-ext-l @extension @ext-l @idempotency @happy-path @post-s10 @post-s1
  Scenario: Idempotent replay -- duplicate idempotency_key returns original result without re-applying
    Given the Buyer Agent previously synced a catalog "feed-100" with idempotency_key "idem-abc-00000001"
    When the Buyer Agent re-sends the same sync_catalogs request with idempotency_key "idem-abc-00000001"
    Then the response is the original recorded SyncCatalogsSuccess result
    And the catalog "feed-100" is not upserted a second time
    And no additional audit events are emitted for the retry
    And no additional platform review is triggered for the retry
    # POST-S10: at-most-once -- retry does not double-apply or re-fire side effects

  @T-UC-023-ext-l-different-account @extension @ext-l @idempotency @happy-path @post-s1
  Scenario: Idempotent replay -- same idempotency_key on a different account is a new execution
    Given the Buyer Agent previously synced a catalog with idempotency_key "idem-xyz-00000001" on account "acct-A"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a sync_catalogs request with idempotency_key "idem-xyz-00000001" on account "acct-B"
    Then the response is a SyncCatalogsSuccess with a catalogs array
    And the catalog is processed as a new execution
    # BR-RULE-211 INV-1: dedup key scoped to (seller, account, idempotency_key); different account -> new execution
