Feature: BR-UC-014 Sponsored Intelligence Session
  As a Buyer
  I want to check offering availability, initiate conversational sessions with brand agents, exchange messages, and terminate sessions
  So that I can engage with sponsored brand experiences inside AI assistants without leaving the conversation context

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows the offering availability status and can view offering details and matching products
  #   POST-S2: Buyer has an active conversational session with a unique session_id and negotiated capabilities
  #   POST-S3: Buyer has received a conversational response from the brand agent
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows the current session status after each message exchange
  #   POST-S5: Buyer has successfully terminated the session and received confirmation
  #   POST-S6: When session terminates with handoff_transaction, Buyer has ACP handoff data for checkout
  #   POST-S7: Buyer has received an offering_token for session continuity correlation
  #   POST-S8: Capability negotiation produces the intersection of host and brand capabilities
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on failure
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what failed and the specific error code
  #   POST-F3: When a session is not found, the error references the provided session_id
  #   POST-F4: When an offering is unavailable, the error includes the reason and may suggest alternatives
  #
  # Rules: BR-RULE-095..104 + BR-RULE-286/287/288 (13 rules, 55 invariants — v3.1; BR-RULE-286 widened to cover si_send_message required fields, INV-5..7 added)

    And the previous brand response rendered a surface with surfaceId "surf-1" containing a Button with componentId "btn-add-to-cart"
    When the host posts a user-action with surfaceId "surf-1", componentId "btn-add-to-cart", and action name "add_to_cart"

    And the Buyer Agent sends si_send_message with session_id "sess-ua-001" and an action_response carrying that user-action
    Then the response contains a brand reply message

  Scenario: SI baseline conformance -- session_id roundtrips from initiate through send_message to terminate
    Given the Buyer Agent calls si_get_offering for offering_id "novamotors_conversational_v1"
    And the response is compliant with the si_get_offering spec
    When the Buyer Agent calls si_initiate_session with intent "User is researching electric vehicles for long road trips"
    Then the response is compliant with the si_initiate_session spec
    And the response should carry a platform-assigned session_id
    When the Buyer Agent calls si_send_message with the captured session_id and a user message
    Then the response is compliant with the si_send_message spec
    And the session_id sent on si_send_message should match the value captured from si_initiate_session
    When the Buyer Agent calls si_terminate_session with the captured session_id and reason "handoff_complete"
    Then the response is compliant with the si_terminate_session spec
    And the session_id sent on si_terminate_session should match the value captured from si_initiate_session
    # si_baseline storyboard exercises the four-call lifecycle:
    #   si_get_offering -> si_initiate_session (returns session_id) ->
    #   si_send_message (echoes session_id) -> si_terminate_session (confirms session_id).
    # The runner captures session_id from initiate and asserts it on every subsequent
    # call. A platform that fabricates a fresh session_id between calls breaks the
    # buyer's session-tracking contract.
