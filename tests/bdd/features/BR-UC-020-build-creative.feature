  #   POST-S2: Buyer knows the output manifest's format_id matches the requested target_format_id
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows the output manifest contains all required assets for the target format
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows the provenance metadata on the output manifest reflects AI generation
  #   POST-F1: Buyer knows the operation failed

    Then the response should include preview renders

  @T-UC-020-preview-failed @post-s7 @preview
  Scenario: Inline preview requested but generation fails - preview_error explains why
    Given the Buyer sends a build_creative request with include_preview true
    And preview generation fails while the build itself succeeds
    When the build_creative response is received
    Then the response should include a creative_manifest
    And the response should include a preview_error explaining the preview failure
    # POST-S7: preview generation failure surfaces a preview_error, manifest still returned
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/build-creative-request.json

  @T-UC-020-preview-not-requested @post-s7 @preview
  Scenario: Inline preview not requested - no preview field
    Given the Buyer sends a build_creative request without include_preview
    When the build_creative response is received
    Then the response should be a successful BuildCreativeResponse
    And the response should not include a preview field
    # POST-S7: preview opt-out -> no preview field
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/build-creative-request.json

    When the Buyer Agent sends a build_creative request
    Then the response should be a successful BuildCreativeResponse
    And the response should include sandbox equals true
    And no real AI generation API calls should have been billed
    And no real billing records should have been created
    # BR-RULE-209 INV-1: inputs validated same as production

  @T-UC-020-sandbox-production @invariant @br-rule-209 @sandbox
  Scenario: Production account build_creative response does not include sandbox flag
    Given the request targets a production account
    And a valid target_format_id referencing an available creative format
    When the Buyer Agent sends a build_creative request

  @T-UC-020-sandbox-validation @invariant @br-rule-209 @sandbox
  Scenario: Sandbox account with invalid format returns real validation error
    Given the request targets a sandbox account
    When the Buyer Agent sends a build_creative request with invalid target_format_id
    Then the response should indicate a validation error
    And the error should be a real validation error, not simulated
    And the error should include a suggestion for how to fix the issue
    # BR-RULE-209 INV-7: sandbox validation errors are real
    # POST-F3: suggestion field present

  @T-UC-020-boundary-sandbox-response @boundary @sandbox @br-rule-209
  Scenario Outline: Sandbox response semantics boundary -- <boundary_point>
    Given the request targets <account_kind>
    And a valid target_format_id referencing an available creative format
    When the Buyer Agent sends a build_creative request
    Then <outcome>
    # v3.1: sandbox response-flag boundaries for build_creative (BR-RULE-209 INV-4/INV-5).
    #       Cross-operation sandbox boundaries (list_accounts filter, sync_accounts request item,
    #       capability declaration, media-buy budget) belong to UC-010/UC-011 features.

    Examples: Boundary values
      | boundary_point                                   | account_kind                            | outcome                                          |
      | sandbox: true in response (sandbox account)      | a sandbox account                       | the response should include sandbox equals true  |
      | sandbox absent in response (production account)  | a production account                    | the response should not include a sandbox field  |
      | sandbox: false in response (explicit production) | a production account with sandbox false | the response should include sandbox equals false |

  @T-UC-020-creative-variable-preserved @v3-1 @creative-variable
  Scenario: build_creative preserves declared CreativeVariable entries from source manifest
    Given the request targets a production account
    And a source creative_manifest declaring a CreativeVariable with variable_id "headline_text" and variable_type "text"
    And a valid target_format_id referencing an available creative format
    When the Buyer Agent sends a build_creative request
    Then the response should be a successful BuildCreativeResponse
    And the output creative_manifest should include a CreativeVariable with variable_id "headline_text" and variable_type "text"
    # POST-S1: output ready for serve-time DCO population
    # POST-S3: declared variables retained alongside required assets
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/build-creative-request.json

  @T-UC-020-creative-variable-required-flag @v3-1 @creative-variable
  Scenario: build_creative preserves required flag on CreativeVariable
    Given the request targets a production account
    And a source creative_manifest declaring a CreativeVariable with required true
    And a valid target_format_id referencing an available creative format
    When the Buyer Agent sends a build_creative request
    Then the response should be a successful BuildCreativeResponse
    And the output CreativeVariable should retain required equal to true
    # POST-S1: serve-time substitution contract preserved across build
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/build-creative-request.json

  @T-UC-020-creative-variable-invalid-type @v3-1 @creative-variable @ext-b
  Scenario: build_creative rejects CreativeVariable with invalid variable_type
    Given the request targets a production account
    And a source creative_manifest declaring a CreativeVariable with variable_type "geometry"
    And a valid target_format_id referencing an available creative format
    When the Buyer Agent sends a build_creative request
    Then the operation should fail with a schema validation error
    And the error code should be "CREATIVE_VALUE_NOT_ALLOWED"
    And the error should identify the invalid variable_type
    And the error should include "suggestion" field
    And the suggestion should contain "variable_type"
    # POST-F2: variable_type enum enforced (text|image|video|audio|url|number|boolean|color|date)
    # POST-F3: field path points at variable_type + recovery suggestion present

  @T-UC-020-creative-rejected-details @v3-1 @error-details @creative-rejected @ext-c
  Scenario: CREATIVE_REJECTED error returns policy reference and rejection reasons
    Given the request targets a production account
    And a creative_brief whose compliance.required_disclosures cannot be satisfied in the target format
    When the Buyer Agent sends a build_creative request
    Then the operation should fail
    And the error code should be "CREATIVE_REJECTED"
    And the error details should include policy_id and a non-empty reasons array
    And the error details should include a policy_url where the full policy can be reviewed
    And the error should include "suggestion" field
    And the suggestion should contain "policy_url"
    # POST-F2: rejection rationale is structured, not free text
    # POST-F3: buyer knows what to revise via the suggestion + policy_url

  @T-UC-020-storyboard-build-vast-tag-from-synced-creative @schema-v3.1 @v3-1 @build-from-library @vast
  Scenario: Build a VAST-compatible serving tag from a synced video creative referenced by creative_id
    Given a video creative has been synced to the library with creative_id "video_30s_trail_pro"
    When the Buyer Agent sends build_creative referencing the creative_id and a target_format_id with id "vast_30s"
    Then the response is compliant with the build_creative success spec
    And the response should carry a serving tag compatible with the VAST target_format_id
    And the response should reference the originating creative_id
    # creative_lifecycle build_video_tag: the buyer references an existing
    # creative_id from a prior sync_creatives call (not an inline creative_brief)
    # and asks the platform to build a serving tag in a target_format_id like
    # vast_30s. The platform produces a VAST-compatible tag the buyer can
    # traffic to ad servers. This anchors the post-sync build flow as distinct
    # from inline pure-generation scenarios.
    # build_video_tag: post-sync build by creative_id produces a target-format serving tag
