Feature: BR-UC-022 Creative Delivery & Features
  As a Buyer
  I want to retrieve creative-level delivery metrics and evaluate creative manifests for governance features
  So that I can understand which creative executions performed best and assess creative compliance

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows the delivery performance of each creative (impressions, clicks, spend, video metrics, conversions)
  #   POST-S2: Buyer can see variant-level breakdowns with rendered manifests showing what was actually served
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows the reporting period (start/end timestamps, timezone) covered by the metrics
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows the currency used for monetary values in the response
  #   POST-S5: Buyer knows the total variant count per creative, even when truncated by max_variants
  #   POST-S6: Buyer knows the governance evaluation results for the submitted creative (feature values with confidence scores)
  #   POST-S7: Buyer knows when each feature evaluation was performed and when it expires
  #   POST-S8: Buyer can access the full assessment report via detail_url (when provided by vendor)
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on failure (both operations are read-only)
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what failed and the specific error code
  #   POST-F3: Buyer knows how to fix the issue and retry (via error suggestion and recovery classification)
  #
  # Rules: BR-RULE-169 (scoping filter), BR-RULE-013 (datetime), BR-RULE-161 (manifest validity),
  #        BR-RULE-132 (capability gate), BR-RULE-170 (variant truncation), BR-RULE-171 (expiry/confidence)
  # Extensions: A (SCOPING_FILTER_REQUIRED), B (MEDIA_BUY_NOT_FOUND), C (CREATIVE_NOT_FOUND),
