Feature: BR-UC-025 Validate Property Delivery Compliance
  As a Buyer
  I want to validate delivery records against a property list and resolve per-record compliance and supply-path authorization
  So that I can determine campaign compliance and drive fix-and-retry from per-feature detail

  # v3.1: get_property_features removed; the single live operation of UC-025 is
  # validate_property_delivery. Former discovery scenarios and INV-189/INV-190
  # invariants are retained as @deprecated for binding stability.
  #
  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: [DEPRECATED v3.1] superseded by POST-S5 (per-record features[] breakdown)
  #   POST-S2: [DEPRECATED v3.1] no live discovery operation in v3.1
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows per-record compliance (compliant / non_compliant / not_covered / unidentified) and aggregate summary
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows supply-path authorization (authorized / unauthorized / unknown) and authorization_summary
  #   POST-S5: Buyer knows per-feature breakdown via features[] (status from feature-check-status enum) with requirement echoed when buyer-authored
  #   POST-S6: Buyer knows validated_at (required) and list_resolved_at (optional)
  #   POST-S7: Buyer knows root-level compliant flag (true iff summary.non_compliant_records == 0)
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on failure (read-only)
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what failed and the specific error code
  #   POST-F3: Application context is still echoed when possible
  #
  # Rules: BR-RULE-189 [DEPRECATED v3.1], BR-RULE-190 [DEPRECATED v3.1],
  #        BR-RULE-191 (Delivery Validation Request), BR-RULE-192 (Delivery Validation Response)
  # Extensions (active v3.1): E (REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND), F (LIST_ACCESS_DENIED), G (RECORDS_REQUIRED),
  #   H (RECORDS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED), K (partial coverage not_covered/unidentified),
  #   L (per-feature failed/warning), M (supply-path authorization unauthorized/unknown),
  #   N (ACCOUNT_REQUIRED multi-account)
  # Extensions (deprecated v3.1): A, B (transport-split validate; consolidated into BR-UC-025-main),
  #   C (PROPERTY_NOT_FOUND), D (PROPERTY_NOT_MONITORED), I (PROPERTY_SELECTION_REQUIRED),
  #   J (PROPERTIES_LIMIT_EXCEEDED)

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the Buyer is authenticated with a valid principal_id


  @T-UC-025-delivery-mcp @main-flow @mcp @post-s3 @post-s5 @post-s6
  Scenario: Delivery validation via MCP -- validate records against property list
    Given the Buyer Agent has an authenticated connection
    And property list "pl-valid" exists and is accessible by the buyer
    And the list contains properties "good.com" and "approved.com"
    When the Buyer Agent invokes validate_property_delivery with list_id "pl-valid" and records containing deliveries to "good.com" (1000 impressions) and "bad.com" (500 impressions)
    Then the response contains list_id "pl-valid"
    And the summary shows total_records 2 with compliant_records 1 and non_compliant_records 1
    And the results array contains the non-compliant record for "bad.com"
    And the non-compliant record has a features[] entry with feature_id "record:list_membership" and status "failed"
    And the response includes validated_at timestamp
    # POST-S3: Buyer knows compliance status
    # POST-S5: Buyer knows per-feature breakdown via features[]
    # POST-S6: Buyer knows validation timestamp
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/property/validate-property-delivery-request.json

  @T-UC-025-delivery-rest @main-flow @rest @post-s3 @post-s6
  Scenario: Delivery validation via REST/A2A -- same semantics as MCP
    Given the Buyer Agent has an authenticated connection
    And property list "pl-valid" exists and is accessible by the buyer
    When the Buyer Agent sends validate_property_delivery via A2A with list_id "pl-valid" and 10 delivery records
    Then the response contains list_id "pl-valid"
    And the summary shows all 10 counters correctly
    And the response includes validated_at timestamp
    # POST-S3: Compliance status via REST
    # POST-S6: Validation timestamp and list resolution
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/property/validate-property-delivery-request.json

  @T-UC-025-delivery-transport @main-flow @post-s3
  Scenario Outline: Delivery validation via <transport> -- equivalent results
    Given the Buyer Agent has an authenticated connection
    And property list "pl-valid" exists with property "example.com"
    When the Buyer Agent sends validate_property_delivery via <transport> with list_id "pl-valid" and 1 record for "example.com" with 1000 impressions
    Then the summary shows total_records 1 and compliant_records 1
    # POST-S3: Equivalent compliance results regardless of transport

    Examples:
      | transport |
      | MCP       |
      | REST      |

  @T-UC-025-validation-statuses @main-flow @invariant @BR-RULE-192 @post-s3
  Scenario Outline: Validation status classification -- <status>
    Given property list "pl-valid" exists and is accessible
    And the delivery record for "<property>" resolves to status "<status>"
    When the Buyer Agent validates delivery with list_id "pl-valid" and 1 record for "<property>"
    Then the result has status "<status>"
    And <features_state>
    # BR-RULE-192 INV-1: exactly one of four statuses
    # BR-RULE-192 INV-13: not_covered (recognized, no data) vs unidentified (type not resolvable) distinct from non_compliant
    # DEPRECATED: upstream removed -- violations[] removed in v3.1; per-failure detail now surfaced via features[].status="failed" (see T-UC-025-feature-failed-detail, T-UC-025-inv192-reserved-namespace)
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/property/validate-property-delivery-request.json

    Examples:
      | status         | property         | features_state                                                    |
      | compliant      | good.com         | no failed features[] entries are present                          |
      | non_compliant  | bad.com          | at least one features[] entry has status "failed"                  |
      | not_covered    | no-data.com      | features[] may be empty or absent                                  |
      | unidentified   | custom-id-xyz    | features[] may be empty or absent                                  |

  @T-UC-025-violation-codes @deprecated @main-flow @ext-a @post-s5
  Scenario Outline: Violation code detail -- <violation_code>
    Given property list "pl-valid" exists and is accessible
    And the delivery record triggers violation "<violation_code>"
    When the Buyer Agent validates delivery with that record
    Then the result has status "non_compliant"
    And the violations array contains an entry with code "<violation_code>"
    And the violation entry includes a message
    # POST-S5: Buyer knows specific violations
    # BR-RULE-192 INV-2: non_compliant has violations
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/property/validate-property-delivery-request.json

    Examples:
      | violation_code    |
      | not_in_list       |
      | excluded          |
      | country_mismatch  |
      | channel_mismatch  |
      | feature_failed    |

  @T-UC-025-feature-failed-detail @main-flow @extension @ext-l @post-s5
  Scenario: Per-feature failure detail -- features[] entry includes feature_id, status, and echoed requirement
    Given property list "pl-valid" with feature requirement carbon_score min_value 50
    And the delivery record is for property "low-carbon.com" which has carbon_score 30
    When the Buyer Agent validates delivery with that record
    Then the result has status "non_compliant"
    And the result features[] contains an entry with feature_id "carbon_score" and status "failed"
    And the features[] entry echoes the buyer-authored requirement min_value 50
    # POST-S5: per-feature failure breakdown with requirement echoed (BR-RULE-192 INV-10)

  @T-UC-025-auth-check @main-flow @post-s4
  Scenario: Supply path authorization -- records with sales_agent_url trigger auth check
    Given property list "pl-valid" exists and is accessible
    And the delivery record for "example.com" includes sales_agent_url "https://agent.example.com/.well-known/adcp"
    And the publisher's adagents.json lists that agent as authorized
    When the Buyer Agent validates delivery with that record
    Then the result includes authorization with status "authorized"
    And the response includes authorization_summary
    And authorization_summary records_checked equals 1
    # POST-S4: Buyer knows authorization status
    # BR-RULE-191 INV-6: sales_agent_url triggers auth check
    # BR-RULE-192 INV-3: authorization_summary present when auth checks performed
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/property/validate-property-delivery-request.json

  @T-UC-025-auth-statuses @main-flow @invariant @BR-RULE-192 @post-s4
  Scenario Outline: Authorization status classification -- <auth_status>
    Given property list "pl-valid" exists and is accessible
    And the delivery record includes sales_agent_url and authorization resolves to "<auth_status>"
    When the Buyer Agent validates delivery with that record
    Then the result authorization status is "<auth_status>"
    # BR-RULE-192 INV-3: auth status is three-valued enum [authorized / unauthorized / unknown]
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/property/validate-property-delivery-request.json

    Examples:
      | auth_status  |
      | authorized   |
      | unauthorized |
      | unknown      |

  @T-UC-025-auth-no-url @main-flow @invariant @BR-RULE-192 @post-s4
  Scenario: No authorization check -- records without sales_agent_url skip auth
    Given property list "pl-valid" exists and is accessible
    And the delivery records do not include sales_agent_url
    When the Buyer Agent validates delivery with those records
    Then no authorization field is present on any result
    And authorization_summary is absent from the response
    # BR-RULE-191 INV-7: no auth check without sales_agent_url
    # BR-RULE-192 INV-3: authorization_summary absent when no auth records
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/property/validate-property-delivery-request.json

  @T-UC-025-auth-mixed @main-flow @post-s4
  Scenario: Mixed authorization -- some records with sales_agent_url, some without
    Given property list "pl-valid" exists and is accessible
    And record for "a.com" includes sales_agent_url
    And record for "b.com" does not include sales_agent_url
    When the Buyer Agent validates delivery with both records
    Then the result for "a.com" includes authorization status
    And the result for "b.com" does not include authorization
    And authorization_summary is present with records_checked 1
    # BR-RULE-191 INV-6/7: per-record opt-in authorization
    # BR-RULE-192 INV-3: summary present because at least one record had URL
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/property/validate-property-delivery-request.json

  @T-UC-025-auth-independence @main-flow @invariant @BR-RULE-192 @post-s3 @post-s4
  Scenario: Authorization independent of compliance -- compliant but unauthorized
    Given property list "pl-valid" with property "legit.com"
    And the delivery record for "legit.com" includes sales_agent_url for an unauthorized agent
    When the Buyer Agent validates delivery with that record
    Then the result has status "compliant" (property is in list)
    And the result has authorization status "unauthorized" (agent not in adagents.json)
    # BR-RULE-192: compliance and authorization are independent checks

  @T-UC-025-summary-consistency @main-flow @invariant @BR-RULE-192 @post-s3
  Scenario: Summary counters are internally consistent
    Given property list "pl-valid" exists and is accessible
    And 100 delivery records resolve to: 60 compliant, 25 non_compliant, 10 not_covered, 5 unidentified
    When the Buyer Agent validates delivery with those 100 records
    Then summary total_records equals 100
    And total_records equals compliant_records + non_compliant_records + not_covered_records + unidentified_records
    And total_impressions equals compliant_impressions + non_compliant_impressions + not_covered_impressions + unidentified_impressions
    # BR-RULE-192 INV-4: total_records consistency
    # BR-RULE-192 INV-5: total_impressions consistency

  @T-UC-025-auth-summary-consistency @main-flow @invariant @BR-RULE-192 @post-s4
  Scenario: Authorization summary counters are internally consistent
    Given property list "pl-valid" exists and is accessible
    And 50 delivery records include sales_agent_url: 40 authorized, 7 unauthorized, 3 unknown
    When the Buyer Agent validates delivery with those records
    Then authorization_summary records_checked equals 50
    And records_checked equals authorized_records + unauthorized_records + unknown_records

  @T-UC-025-include-compliant @main-flow @invariant @BR-RULE-192 @post-s3
  Scenario Outline: Include compliant flag -- <flag_state>
    Given property list "pl-valid" with 10 records: 8 compliant, 2 non_compliant
    When the Buyer Agent validates delivery with include_compliant <flag_state>

  @T-UC-025-all-compliant-default @main-flow @post-s3
  Scenario: All compliant records with default filter -- results array empty
    Given property list "pl-valid" with all records compliant
    When the Buyer Agent validates delivery with include_compliant omitted
    Then the results array is empty
    And the summary shows all records as compliant
    # BR-RULE-192 INV-7: all compliant + default filter = empty results

    Given property list "pl-valid" exists and is accessible
    When the Buyer Agent sends validate_property_delivery with list_id "pl-valid" and <records_state>
    Then the operation should fail
    And the error code should be "INVALID_REQUEST"
