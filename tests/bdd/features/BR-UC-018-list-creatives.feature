Feature: BR-UC-018 List Creatives
  As a Buyer
  I want to query the Seller's creative library with filtering, sorting, pagination, and field projection
  So that I can discover, search, and evaluate creative assets for media buy decisions

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows which creatives match their filter criteria
  #   POST-S2: Buyer knows the total number of matching creatives and current page position
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows the core attributes (ID, name, format_id, status, dates) for each returned creative
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows which packages each creative is assigned to (when assignments requested)
  #   POST-S5: Buyer knows the lightweight delivery snapshot for each creative (when include_snapshot requested), or a snapshot_unavailable_reason
  #   POST-S6: Buyer knows the items for multi-asset creatives (when include_items requested)
  #   POST-S7: Buyer knows which filters and sort order were applied to produce the results
  #   POST-S8: Buyer knows the dynamic-content variables / DCO slots for each creative (when include_variables requested)
  #   POST-S9: Buyer knows the pricing options for each creative (when include_pricing requested and an account is provided)
  #   POST-F1: Buyer knows the operation failed
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what went wrong (error explains the failure)
  #   POST-F3: Buyer knows how to recover (suggestion for corrective action)
  #
  # Rules: BR-RULE-146 (defaults), BR-RULE-147 (pagination/sorting), BR-RULE-148 (filter semantics),
  #        BR-RULE-149 (field selector/error tolerance), BR-RULE-034 (cross-principal isolation),
  #        BR-RULE-209 (sandbox semantics), BR-RULE-225 (pricing disclosure gate), BR-RULE-226 (snapshot unavailability)

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the Buyer is authenticated as principal "buyer-001"


  @T-UC-018-main @main-flow
  Scenario: List creatives -- default query returns non-archived creatives
    Given the authenticated principal has 5 creatives with statuses "approved", "processing", "rejected", "pending_review", "archived"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request with no parameters
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And the response contains a creatives array with 4 items
    And the archived creative is not included in the results
    And each creative includes creative_id, name, format_id, status, created_date, updated_date
    And the query_summary shows total_matching as 4 and returned as 4
    And the query_summary shows sort_applied as "created_date desc"
    And the pagination shows has_more as false
    # BR-RULE-146 INV-1: No filters -> all non-archived creatives for principal
    # BR-RULE-147 INV-1: No pagination -> default page size 50
    # BR-RULE-147 INV-3: No sort -> created_date descending
    # POST-S1: Buyer knows which creatives match (4 non-archived)
    # POST-S2: Buyer knows total count and page position
    # POST-S3: Buyer knows core attributes
    # POST-S7: Buyer knows applied filters and sort
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/creative/list-creatives-request.json

  @T-UC-018-main-enriched @main-flow
  Scenario: List creatives with assignments included by default
    Given the authenticated principal has 2 approved creatives with package assignments
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request with no parameters
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And the response contains a creatives array with 2 items
    And each creative includes assignment data
    # BR-RULE-149 INV-3: include_assignments defaults to true
    # POST-S4: Buyer knows package assignments (default included)
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/creative/list-creatives-request.json

  @T-UC-018-main-performance @main-flow
  Scenario: List creatives with explicit delivery snapshot request
    Given the authenticated principal has 2 approved creatives
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request with include_snapshot true
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And each creative includes a snapshot_unavailable_reason of "SNAPSHOT_UNSUPPORTED"
    # BR-RULE-149 INV-4: include_snapshot defaults to false, must explicitly request
    # POST-S5: Buyer knows the lightweight delivery snapshot, OR a machine-readable reason
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/creative/list-creatives-request.json
    #
    # Was "each creative includes a delivery snapshot", over a Given that promised
    # "creatives with delivery snapshot data". This seller has no such data to seed: no
    # column in this schema holds a creative's lifetime impressions or last-served date.
    # The pin does not require a seller to have them -- it requires a seller that does not
    # to SAY SO, through snapshot_unavailable_reason, whose SNAPSHOT_UNSUPPORTED member is
    # described as "The seller platform does not support delivery snapshots for this
    # entity" (enums/snapshot-unavailable-reason.json). That disclosure is what POST-S5
    # leaves the buyer knowing here, and it is what this scenario now grades.

  @T-UC-018-main-subassets @main-flow
  Scenario: List creatives with explicit items request
    Given the authenticated principal has a multi-asset creative with items
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request with include_items true
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And the creative includes items data
    # BR-RULE-149 INV-5: include_items defaults to false, must explicitly request
    # POST-S6: Buyer knows the items for multi-asset creatives (when requested)
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/creative/list-creatives-request.json

  @T-UC-018-main-variables @main-flow
  Scenario: List creatives with explicit variables request
    Given the authenticated principal has a creative with dynamic-content variables
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request with include_variables true
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And the creative includes variables data
    # BR-RULE-149 INV-7: include_variables defaults to false, must explicitly request
    # POST-S8: Buyer knows dynamic-content variables / DCO slots (when requested)

  @T-UC-018-ext-a @extension @ext-a @error
  Scenario: Authentication required -- no credentials
    Given the Buyer has no authentication credentials
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the operation should fail with error code "AUTH_MISSING"
    And the error code should be "AUTH_MISSING"
    And the error should include a "suggestion" field
    # POST-F1: Buyer knows the operation failed
    # POST-F2: Error explains authentication is required
    # POST-F3: Suggestion advises providing valid credentials

  @T-UC-018-ext-b @extension @ext-b @error
  Scenario: Tenant unavailable -- identity has no tenant mapping
    Given no tenant can be resolved from the request context
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the operation should fail with error code "AUTH_MISSING"
    And the error code should be "AUTH_MISSING"
    And the error should include a "suggestion" field
    # Was AUTH_REQUIRED, and before that this feature's header lists TENANT_REQUIRED —
    # a code enums/error-code.json does not carry at 3.1.1. The pinned enum DOES carry
    # AUTH_MISSING, whose own enumMetadata suggestion is "provide credentials via the auth
    # header and retry", and that is what the request expresses: this Given sends NO
    # HEADERS AT ALL, so the seller is told neither who is calling nor which tenant. There
    # being no pinned code for an unresolvable tenant, the seller reports the
    # authentication state it can see, which is the same one the ext-a scenario asserts.
    # POST-F1: Buyer knows the operation failed
    # POST-F2: Error explains tenant context could not be determined
    # POST-F3: Suggestion advises ensuring credentials map to a valid tenant

  @T-UC-018-ext-c @extension @ext-c @error
  Scenario Outline: Validation failure -- <description>
    Given the Buyer is authenticated
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request with <invalid_param>
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the operation should fail with error code "INVALID_REQUEST"
    And the error code should be "INVALID_REQUEST"
    And the error field should contain "<error_detail>"
    And the error should include a "suggestion" field
    # POST-F1: Buyer knows the operation failed
    # POST-F2: Error explains which parameters are invalid
    # POST-F3: Suggestion provides valid parameter values

    Examples:
      | description                  | invalid_param                          | error_detail     |
      | invalid status enum          | statuses filter "unknown"              | status           |
      | empty statuses array         | statuses filter as empty array         | statuses         |
      | non-integer max_results      | pagination max_results "abc"           | max_results      |
      | empty fields array           | fields as empty array                  | fields           |
      | unknown field enum           | fields containing "thumbnail"          | field            |
      | empty tags array             | tags filter as empty array             | tags             |
      | creative_ids over max        | creative_ids with 101 items            | creative_ids     |
      | non-string field item        | fields containing integer 123          | field            |

  @T-UC-018-ext-d @extension @ext-d @error
  Scenario Outline: Invalid date format -- <date_field> with value "<value>"
    Given the Buyer is authenticated
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request with <date_field> as "<value>"
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the operation should fail with error code "INVALID_REQUEST"
    And the error code should be "INVALID_REQUEST"
    # The two lines above asked for two DIFFERENT codes for one refusal, so no
    # implementation could satisfy the scenario. Reconciled to INVALID_REQUEST: a value
    # that is not a date-time violates a SCHEMA CONSTRAINT on
    # core/creative-filters.json's created_after/created_before (format: date-time),
    # which pinned 3.1.1 assigns to INVALID_REQUEST ("violates schema constraints"),
    # not to VALIDATION_ERROR ("beyond schema validation").
    And the error field should contain "<date_field>"
    And the error should include a "suggestion" field
    # POST-F1: Buyer knows the operation failed
    # POST-F2: Error explains which date field is invalid
    # POST-F3: Suggestion provides expected ISO 8601 format

    Examples:
      | date_field     | value         |
      | created_after  | not-a-date    |
      | created_after  | yesterday     |
      | created_before | 2024/01/15    |
      | created_before | Jan 15, 2024  |

    And <outcome>

    # Every "only ..." outcome now names the same obligation, because it IS the same
    # obligation in each row and the row's own request_params cell says which fields were
    # asked for: the response carries the selected members and the six
    # list-creatives-response.json marks REQUIRED on every item, and nothing else. The
    # cells used to say "only creative_id field", which no conformant seller can produce —
    # `fields` cannot express keeping the required members, so a projection that dropped
    # them would answer a selection with a document violating the schema it was selected
    # from.
    #
    # The all-13 cell asks for every enum member, which is by definition what an omitted
    # `fields` returns, so it asserts the same thing the `omitted` row does. It is NOT
    # key-presence of 13: a creative legitimately omits an empty tag list, and this seller
    # omits the members it does not hold.
    #
    # invalid_db_status_tolerance is GONE from this outline: its request_params cell
    # ("database has creative with unrecognized status value") describes a database
    # fixture, not a request, so the row had nothing to dispatch. That obligation has its
    # own scenario, @T-UC-018-inv-149-6-holds, which grades it end to end.

  # BR-RULE-226 INV-1 IS DELETED. It asserted that a snapshot comes back "when available",
  # over a Given promising a creative "with available delivery snapshot data". No column in
  # this schema holds a per-creative lifetime impression count or last-served date, and the
  # pin does not oblige a seller to have one -- list-creatives-request.json makes
  # include_snapshot a request, and snapshot-unavailable-reason.json is how a seller without
  # the capability answers. There is therefore no state of this seller in which the
  # scenario's precondition holds, and the obligation that does bind it -- the disclosure --
  # is INV-2 below. Restoring INV-1 belongs with a delivery-snapshot source, not with a
  # test.

  @T-UC-018-inv-226-2-holds @invariant @BR-RULE-226
  Scenario Outline: BR-RULE-226 INV-2 holds -- snapshot unavailable surfaces machine-readable reason -- <reason>
    Given the authenticated principal has an approved creative whose snapshot is unavailable due to <condition>
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request with include_snapshot true
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And the creative in the response omits the snapshot
    And the creative includes a snapshot_unavailable_reason of "<reason>"
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/creative/list-creatives-request.json
    #
    # One row, not three. The enum's other two members name conditions this seller cannot
    # be in, and the enum says so itself: SNAPSHOT_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE is "Snapshot data
    # exists but is temporarily unavailable (e.g., cache miss, pipeline lag)" -- there is no
    # snapshot data and no pipeline for it to lag -- and SNAPSHOT_PERMISSION_DENIED is "The
    # caller lacks permission to view snapshot data for this entity", which needs a
    # per-entity snapshot permission this seller does not model. A row whose precondition
    # cannot be established grades nothing; both belong with the capability that would make
    # them reachable.

    Examples:
      | condition                             | reason                            |
      | the platform never supports snapshots | SNAPSHOT_UNSUPPORTED              |

  @T-UC-018-inv-226-3-holds @invariant @BR-RULE-226
  Scenario: BR-RULE-226 INV-3 holds -- no snapshot fields when include_snapshot omitted
    Given the authenticated principal has an approved creative whose snapshot is unavailable
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request without specifying include_snapshot
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And the creative in the response includes neither a snapshot nor a snapshot_unavailable_reason

  @T-UC-018-partition-snapshot-unavailable @partition @snapshot-unavailable
  Scenario Outline: Snapshot unavailability disclosure -- <partition>
    Given the authenticated principal has an approved creative

    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And <outcome>
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/creative/list-creatives-request.json

    # The three rows this outline lost are the two unreachable enum members (see the
    # BR-RULE-226 INV-2 note) and reason_not_in_enum, whose request_params cell named a
    # RESPONSE field: a buyer cannot send snapshot_unavailable_reason, so there was no
    # request for the row to make. That the seller never emits a non-enum reason is graded
    # on every row here by the compliance Then, which validates the response against
    # list-creatives-response.json and its $ref to the closed enum.

    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And <outcome>

    # Same two deletions as the partition outline above, for the same two reasons: the

  @T-UC-018-ext-e @extension @ext-e @degradation
  Scenario: Snapshot unavailable -- the listing still succeeds, with the reason on every creative
    Given the authenticated principal has approved creatives
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request with include_snapshot true
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And the operation succeeds and returns the full creatives array
    And each creative includes a snapshot_unavailable_reason of "SNAPSHOT_UNSUPPORTED"
    # POST-S5: degraded result is explained, not silently dropped
    #
    # Was an outline over the three enum members, asserting a MIXED response: one affected
    # creative carrying a reason while "creatives with available snapshots still include
    # their snapshot". This seller cannot produce that mixture, because it supports
    # snapshots for no creative at all (see the BR-RULE-226 INV-2 note), so the degradation
    # is uniform: every creative carries the reason, and the listing still succeeds with the
    # full array rather than failing or dropping rows. That is the half of POST-S5 this
    # seller can be held to, and it is the half the extension exists for.

  @T-UC-018-storyboard-list-all-creatives-after-sync @schema-v3.1 @v3-1 @list-after-sync
  Scenario: List creatives with no filters returns the library including recently synced creatives
    Given the buyer recently synced three creatives in three different formats via sync_creatives
    When the Buyer Agent sends list_creatives with no filters for the same account
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And the creatives array should include each of the synced creatives
    And each creative entry should expose creative_id, name, format_id, and status
    # creative_lifecycle list_and_filter / list_all: after sync_creatives,
    # list_creatives without filters returns the library for the account
    # including the synced items. Each entry exposes creative_id, name,
    # format_id, status. The graded step lives inside the `creative` protocol
    # baseline storyboard; capabilities.py declares supported_protocols=[media_buy]
    # only, so this behavior is schema-grounded for us, not storyboard-graded
    # (matches the sibling scenarios in this file already tagged @schema-v3.1

  @T-UC-018-storyboard-filter-by-format-id-object @schema-v3.1 @v3-1 @list-filter @format-id-object
  Scenario: List creatives filtered by a format_id object returns only creatives matching that {agent_url, id}
    Given the buyer has synced creatives in formats including {agent_url, "display_300x250"} and {agent_url, "video_30s"}
    When the Buyer Agent sends list_creatives with filters.format_ids carrying one format_id object {agent_url, "display_300x250"}
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And the creatives array should only include creatives whose format_id matches both agent_url and id
    And the creatives array should NOT include creatives whose format_id has a different id even on the same agent_url
    # creative_lifecycle list_filtered: the buyer filters by a format_id object
    # (agent_url + id). Only creatives whose format_id matches both fields are
    # returned. A filter shaped as a bare string id (not an object) is not part
    # of the v3.1 contract; format_ids are objects, period.

  @T-UC-018-storyboard-filter-by-concept-id @schema-v3.1 @v3-1 @list-filter @concept-id
  Scenario: List creatives filtered by concept_ids returns only creatives in that concept carrying concept_id and concept_name
    Given the authenticated principal has creatives grouped under concept "concept_summer_2026" and other creatives under different concepts
    When the Buyer Agent sends list_creatives with filters.concept_ids ["concept_summer_2026"]
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And the creatives array should only include creatives belonging to concept "concept_summer_2026"
    And each returned creative should carry concept_id "concept_summer_2026" and a concept_name
    # v3.1 ADDED filter filters.concept_ids (array of concept-id strings, minItems 1).
    # Concepts group related creatives across sizes and formats. Satisfies the
    # User Intent "List creatives in this concept with their DCO variables" and the

  @T-UC-018-filter-boolean-flags @list-filter @boolean-filter @v3-1
  Scenario Outline: v3.1 boolean filter <flag> partitions the library
    Given the authenticated principal has both creatives matching and not matching <flag>
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request with <flag> <value>
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And <outcome>
    # v3.1 ADDED boolean CreativeFilters has_variables (DCO vs static) and
    # has_served (has served >=1 impression vs never served). Each partitions
    # the principal's library into the matching subset.

    # has_served LEFT this outline for the filter-semantics one, as an invalid partition.
    # Its two rows shared this Given, which for has_served promises a library where some
    # creatives have served: no column in this schema records a creative's impressions, so
    # that state cannot be seeded and the filter cannot be evaluated. The seller refuses it
    # rather than answering a different question, and the refusal is graded where the other
    # unanswerable filters are.
    Examples: Boolean filter partitions
      | flag          | value | outcome                                                          |
      | has_variables | true  | only creatives with dynamic variables (DCO) are returned          |
      | has_variables | false | only static creatives (no dynamic variables) are returned         |

  @T-UC-018-boundary-creative-status @boundary @creative-status
  Scenario Outline: Creative status filter boundary -- <boundary_point>
    Given the authenticated principal has creatives in statuses "processing", "approved", "rejected", "pending_review", "archived"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request with <request_params>
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And <outcome>

    Examples: Boundary values
      | boundary_point                                                                  | request_params                          | outcome                                                          |

      | Not provided (default excludes archived; or seller has no review lifecycle)     | no statuses filter                      | all non-archived creatives are returned (archived excluded by default) |

  @T-UC-018-boundary-sandbox-response @boundary @sandbox @br-rule-209
  Scenario Outline: Sandbox response semantics boundary -- <boundary_point>
    Given the authenticated principal has creatives
    And the request targets <account_kind>
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creatives request
    Then the response is compliant with the list_creatives spec
    And <outcome>

    Examples: Boundary values
      | boundary_point                                  | account_kind                          | outcome                                          |
      | sandbox: true in response (sandbox account)     | a sandbox account                     | the response should include sandbox equals true   |
      | sandbox absent in response (production account) | a production account                  | the response should not include a sandbox field   |
      | sandbox omitted for an explicitly non-sandbox account | a production account                | the response should not include a sandbox field   |
    # The third row asked for an explicit `sandbox: false`. The pinned response schema
    # defines only what TRUE means — "this response contains simulated data from sandbox
    # mode" — and attaches no obligation to the false case, while BR-RULE-209 INV-5 says a
    # production account's response omits the field. So on this seller's wire an
    # explicitly-non-sandbox account is indistinguishable from one that says nothing: both
    # omit the flag, which is what the row now asserts.
