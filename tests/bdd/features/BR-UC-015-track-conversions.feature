Feature: BR-UC-015 Track Conversions
  As a Buyer
  I want to configure event sources and log conversion events for attribution
  So that I can track purchases, leads, and other conversions for campaign optimization

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer has configured event sources and received per-source action results with setup instructions
  #   POST-S2: Buyer can discover all event sources on an account without modification
  #   POST-S3: Buyer has sent conversion events and received confirmation with events_received and events_processed counts
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows the match quality score for the submitted event batch
  #   POST-S5: Buyer is informed of any partial failures with per-event error details
  #   POST-S6: Buyer is informed of any warnings
  #   POST-S7: Buyer can validate integration using test events without affecting production data
  #   POST-S8: Buyer-managed event sources not in a clean-sync request are removed when delete_missing is true
  #   POST-S9: Application context from the request is echoed unchanged in the response
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on failure
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what failed and the specific error code
  #   POST-F3: Application context is still echoed when possible
  #   POST-F4: When an event source is not found, the error references the provided event_source_id

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the Buyer is authenticated with a valid principal_id

  Scenario Outline: Discover event sources via <transport> -- returns all sources on account
    Given an account "acc_acme_001" has 2 buyer-managed and 1 seller-managed event sources
    And the Buyer Agent has an authenticated connection via <transport>
    When the Buyer Agent sends a sync_event_sources request via <transport> with account "acc_acme_001" and no event_sources
    Then the response contains an event_sources array with 3 items
    And each source includes event_source_id, managed_by, and action "unchanged"
    And seller-managed sources have managed_by "seller"
    And buyer-managed sources have managed_by "buyer"
    And the request context is echoed in the response
    # POST-S2: Buyer can discover all event sources without modification
    # POST-S9: Application context echoed unchanged
    # BR-RULE-105 INV-5: Response contains both buyer-managed and seller-managed sources
    # BR-RULE-106 INV-1: discovery-only mode (event_sources omitted)

  Scenario: Discover event sources -- account with no sources returns empty array
    Given an account "acc_new_001" has 0 event sources
    When the Buyer Agent sends a sync_event_sources request with account "acc_new_001" and no event_sources
    Then the response contains an empty event_sources array
    And the response is not an error

  @T-UC-015-003 @main-flow @post-s2 @br-rule-105
  Scenario: Discover event sources -- seller-managed sources are read-only
    Given an account has a seller-managed event source "platform_pixel"
    When the Buyer Agent discovers event sources on the account
    Then the source "platform_pixel" has managed_by "seller"
    And the source "platform_pixel" has action "unchanged"
    # BR-RULE-105 INV-6: Seller-managed sources cannot be updated or deleted by buyer

  @T-UC-015-sync-partial-failure-per-source @extension @post-s1 @br-rule-106 @inv-8
  Scenario: Sync event sources -- one source fails while others succeed resolves to success branch with per-source failed action
    Given an account "acc_acme_001" exists
    When the Buyer Agent syncs event_sources where source "src_ok" is valid and source "src_bad" fails to process
    Then the response contains an event_sources array and no top-level errors
    And "src_ok" appears with action "created"
    And "src_bad" appears with action "failed"
    And "src_bad" includes a populated per-source errors array

    When the Buyer Agent logs the same event (evt_001, purchase, src_web) again
    Then the event is counted as received but not double-processed
    And events_received reflects the count
    And events_processed does not double-count

    Given seller "seller_a" has already processed a sync_event_sources request with idempotency_key "shared-key-2026-05-26-aa"
    When seller "seller_b" sends a sync_event_sources request with the same idempotency_key "shared-key-2026-05-26-aa"
    Then the request for "seller_b" is processed as a new independent request
    And the seller does not correlate it with the "seller_a" request
    # BR-RULE-232 INV-4: idempotency_key is scoped per (seller, request); no cross-seller correlation
    # boundary: same key value submitted by a different seller

  @T-UC-015-health-status-enum @v31 @health @enum @partition
  Scenario Outline: event source health -- status must be a valid assessment-status enum member
    Given an account has a buyer-managed source "src_web" for which the seller evaluates health
    When the Buyer Agent discovers event sources and source "src_web" returns health status "<status>"
    Then the health status value is <validity> per /schemas/enums/assessment-status.json
    # boundary: status outside assessment-status enum
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/sync-event-sources-request.json

    Examples:
      | status       | validity |
      | insufficient | valid    |
      | minimum      | valid    |
      | good         | valid    |
      | excellent    | valid    |
      | unknown      | invalid  |
      | GOOD         | invalid  |
      |              | invalid  |

  @T-UC-015-health-numeric-bounds @v31 @health @boundary
  Scenario Outline: event source health -- numeric sub-fields honor their bounds
    Given an account has a buyer-managed source "src_web" for which the seller evaluates health
    When the source "src_web" returns health field "<field>" with value "<value>"
    Then the value is <validity> for the health object
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/sync-event-sources-request.json

    Examples:
      | field               | value | validity |
      | match_rate          | 0     | valid    |
      | match_rate          | 1     | valid    |
      | match_rate          | 0.73  | valid    |
      | match_rate          | -0.1  | invalid  |
      | match_rate          | 1.5   | invalid  |
      | events_received_24h | 0     | valid    |
      | events_received_24h | 1500  | valid    |
      | events_received_24h | -1    | invalid  |

  @T-UC-015-health-status-required-when-present @v31 @health @dependency
  Scenario: event source health -- health object is optional but status is required when health is present
    Given an account has a buyer-managed source "src_web"
    When the seller returns source "src_web" with a health object that omits the status field
    Then the health object is invalid because status is required when health is present
    # health is optional per source; when present, status (assessment-status) is REQUIRED
    # boundary: health present but status omitted
    # boundary: health present with status only
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/sync-event-sources-request.json

  @T-UC-015-health-absent-when-not-evaluated @v31 @health @partition
  Scenario: event source health -- health field is absent when the seller does not evaluate source quality
    Given an account has a buyer-managed source "src_web" for which the seller does not evaluate health
    When the Buyer Agent discovers event sources on the account
    Then source "src_web" is returned without a health field
    # health is OPTIONAL: absent when the seller does not compute health (success path unaffected)
    # boundary: health omitted (seller does not evaluate)
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/sync-event-sources-request.json

  @T-UC-015-task-history-entry-type-enum @v31 @history-entry-type @enum @partition @br-21
  Scenario Outline: Task execution history -- entry_type must be one of request|response
    Given the Buyer Agent inspects the execution history of a tracked sync_event_sources or log_event task
    When the history contains an entry with entry_type "<entry_type>"
    Then the entry_type value is <validity> per /schemas/enums/history-entry-type.json
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/sync-event-sources-request.json

    Examples:
      | entry_type | validity |
      | request    | valid    |
      | response   | valid    |
      | event      | invalid  |
      | REQUEST    | invalid  |
      |            | invalid  |

  @T-UC-015-history-entries-paired-request-response @v31 @history-entry-type @br-21 @post-s3
  Scenario: log_event task history records a request entry then a response entry
    Given the Buyer Agent submits a log_event request that the Seller Agent processes asynchronously
    When the Buyer Agent fetches the task execution history
    Then the history contains exactly one entry with entry_type "request"
    And the history contains exactly one entry with entry_type "response"
    And every entry_type value is drawn from /schemas/enums/history-entry-type.json
