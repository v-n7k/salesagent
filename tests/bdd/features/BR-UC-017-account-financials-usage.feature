Feature: BR-UC-017 Account Financials & Usage Reporting
  As a Buyer
  I want to query the financial status of an operator-billed account and report vendor service consumption
  So that I can make informed spend decisions and ensure vendor billing is accurate

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows the account's currency and the actual billing period covered
  #   POST-S2: Buyer knows the seller's billing timezone for interpreting date boundaries
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows the total spend for the period (and optionally the active media buy count)
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows the credit position (credit limit, available credit, utilization) for credit-based accounts
  #   POST-S5: Buyer knows the prepay balance (available funds, last top-up) for prepay accounts
  #   POST-S6: Buyer knows the overall payment status (current, past_due, or suspended)
  #   POST-S7: Buyer knows the payment terms in effect (e.g., net_30, prepay)
  #   POST-S8: Buyer can review recent invoices with their status, amounts, and due dates
  #   POST-S9: Seller knows how many usage records were accepted and stored
  #   POST-S10: Seller can track earned revenue for each vendor service consumed
  #   POST-S11: Seller can verify that the correct pricing option and rate were applied
  #   POST-S12: Buyer knows how many records were accepted (accepted count)
  #   POST-S13: Buyer knows which individual records failed and why (per-record errors with field paths)
  #   POST-S14: Buyer knows whether the account is a sandbox (no billing occurred)
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on failure (get_account_financials is read-only; report_usage rejects invalid records)
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what failed and the specific error code
  #   POST-F3: Application context is still echoed when possible
  #
  # Rules: BR-RULE-132..145, BR-RULE-043 (15 rules, ~47 invariants)
  # Extensions: A (UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE), B (ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND), C (INVALID_USAGE_DATA),

    # XFAIL-EXPECTED: production gap — #1722 (get_account_financials not implemented; feature dormant).
    # Re-homed from #1592 to #1722 by KonstantinMirin's decision (2026-07-27): UC-017 account
    # financials and usage reporting are out of the #1592 core slice and are tracked in #1722.
    # The #1521 fixture blocker IS resolved (ck_accounts_billing now permits advertiser — models.py,
    # guarded by tests/unit/test_billing_party_parity.py), so advertiser-billed accounts are seedable.
    # What still blocks greening is not the fixture: `get_account_financials` has no production
    # surface (0 hits in src/), and UC-017 has no binding module and no step module, so this scenario
    # collects on no transport. Greening it requires the full UC-017 binding plus the greenfield tool.
    # get_account_financials is operator-billed only: agent- and advertiser-billed accounts are
    # invoiced outside the operator's billing relationship, so financials are UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE

  Scenario: Report usage -- record links to build_variant_id for variant-leaf billing audit
    Given an operator-billed account "acct_001" exists
    And a valid reporting period
    When the Buyer Agent submits a usage record with creative_id "cr_88201", build_variant_id "bv_leaf_042", and pricing_option_id "po_video_cpm"
    Then the response contains accepted count of 1
    And the response does not contain an errors array
    # XFAIL-EXPECTED: production gap — #1722 (report_usage tool not implemented; feature dormant —
    # no tests/bdd/test_uc017_*.py binding module and no uc017 step module exist, so this scenario
    # collects on no transport). Re-homed from #1592 to #1722 by KonstantinMirin's decision
    # (2026-07-27): UC-017 account financials and usage reporting are tracked in #1722.
    # NEW in 3.1.1: when the reported creative_id was promoted from a build_creative variant
    # leaf and differs from the source build_variant_id, the record carries build_variant_id so
    # billing reconciliation can link usage back to the exact produced leaf (pricing_option_id
    # alone is not unique across leaves); omitted on the canonical path where creative_id IS the
    # build_variant_id, and for creatives with no build-variant lineage
