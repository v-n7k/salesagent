Feature: BR-UC-001 Discover Available Inventory
  As a Buyer (via Buyer Agent)
  I want to discover what advertising inventory matches my campaign requirements
  So that I can evaluate products and proceed to purchasing

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows what inventory matches their request (may be empty)
  #   POST-S2: Buyer can evaluate each product's pricing, formats, reporting_capabilities (delivery_measurement optional), and catalog match data
  #   POST-S3: Buyer sees products ordered by relevance to their brief (when buying_mode is brief)
  #   POST-S4: Buyer only sees products they are authorized to access (implementation-only — not in protocol)
  #   POST-S5: Buyer knows the discovery request completed successfully
  #   POST-S6: Buyer can evaluate publisher-recommended proposals with budget allocations
  #   POST-S7: Buyer knows whether more results are available and how to retrieve them
  #   POST-S8: Buyer knows whether catalog matching was applied and which items matched
  #   POST-S9: Buyer knows the status of each refinement request
  #   POST-S10: Buyer receives only the requested product fields when sparse field selection is used
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged (read-only operation)
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows why the request failed
  #   POST-F3: Buyer knows how to fix the issue and retry

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant exists with at least one product in the catalog

  Scenario: Main flow - brief mode discovery via MCP
    Given the Buyer is authenticated with a valid principal_id
    And the tenant brand_manifest_policy is "require_auth"
    And the tenant has an advertising_policy configured
    And the product catalog contains products with valid schema (format_ids, publisher_properties, pricing_options, reporting_capabilities)
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_products request with:

    Then the response status should be "completed"
    And the response should contain "products" array
    And each product should have product_id, name, format_ids, publisher_properties, pricing_options, and reporting_capabilities
    And the products should be ordered by relevance_score descending
    And each product should include brief_relevance explanation
    # POST-S1: Buyer knows what inventory matches their brief
    # POST-S2: Buyer can evaluate each product's pricing, formats, reporting_capabilities
    # POST-S3: Products ordered by relevance to brief

    Then the response status should be "completed"
    And the resolved collection's genre_taxonomy should be "iab_content_3.0"
    And each genre value should be a valid identifier within the declared taxonomy

  @T-UC-001-v31-genre-taxonomy-custom @v3.1 @collection @genre-taxonomy
  Scenario: Collection with custom genre_taxonomy uses free-form values
    Given the Buyer is authenticated with a valid principal_id
    And a collection declares genre_taxonomy "custom" and genre values "publisher-pop-culture" and "publisher-deep-dive"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_products request with:
    | field       | value                            |
    | buying_mode | wholesale                        |
    | brand       | {"domain": "acme.com"}           |
    Then the response status should be "completed"
    And the resolved collection's genre_taxonomy should be "custom"
    And genre values should be passed through verbatim without taxonomy validation
    # G38: taxonomy validation is conditional on the declared taxonomy

  @T-UC-001-v31-production-quality-tiers @v3.1 @collection @production-quality
  Scenario Outline: Collection production_quality maps to OpenRTB content.prodq - <quality>
    Given a collection declares production_quality "<quality>"
    When a buyer requests products referencing that collection
    Then the resolved collection.production_quality should equal "<quality>"
    And the OpenRTB content.prodq value should equal <openrtb_prodq>
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/get-products-request.json

    Examples:
      | quality      | openrtb_prodq |
      | professional | 1             |
      | prosumer     | 2             |

  @T-UC-001-v31-collection-relationship @v3.1 @collection @collection-relationship
  Scenario: Related collections expose typed relationships
    Given a collection "after-show" declares a related_collections entry with collection_id "main-show" and relationship "spinoff"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_products request with:
    | field       | value                            |
    | buying_mode | wholesale                        |
    | brand       | {"domain": "acme.com"}           |
    Then the resolved collection.related_collections should include collection_id "main-show" with relationship "spinoff"
    And the relationship value should be one of "spinoff", "companion", "sequel", "prequel", or "crossover"

    Given a collection declares cadence "<cadence>"
    When the seller validates the collection schema
    Then the cadence value should be <validity>
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/get-products-request.json

  Scenario Outline: distribution-identifier-type partition validation - <id_type>
    Given a collection_distribution entry uses identifier type "<id_type>"
    When the seller validates the collection-distribution schema
    Then the identifier type should be <validity>
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/get-products-request.json

    Given a publisher identity declares identifier type "<id_type>"
    When the seller validates the publisher identifier
    Then the identifier type should be <validity>

    Examples:

  @T-UC-001-storyboard-proposal-finalize-action @schema-v3.1 @v3.1 @proposal @refine @finalize-action
  Scenario: Proposal finalize action transitions proposal_status from draft to committed
    Given a previous get_products response returned a proposal with proposal_status "draft"
    And the buyer holds the proposal_id captured from that response
    When the Buyer Agent sends get_products with buying_mode "refine" and a refine entry with scope "proposal", proposal_id, and action "finalize"
    Then the response should contain "proposals" array
    And the finalized proposal's proposal_status should be "committed"
    And the finalized proposal should carry an "expires_at" timestamp for the inventory hold window
    And the finalized proposal should carry firm pricing rather than indicative pricing
    And the finalized proposal may carry an insertion_order with an io_id for downstream create_media_buy acceptance
    # proposal_finalize storyboard: full proposal lifecycle through get_products
    #   brief -> proposals (draft, indicative pricing)
    #   refine (scope=proposal, ask=...) -> updated proposal (still draft)
    #   refine (scope=proposal, action=finalize) -> committed (firm pricing, expires_at)
    # The finalize action is the protocol's commitment trigger -- before this, pricing
    # is indicative; after, the seller holds inventory until expires_at.
    # proposal_finalize: action=finalize is the commitment trigger; pricing transitions from indicative to firm
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/compliance/source/protocols/media-buy/scenarios/proposal_finalize.yaml

  @T-UC-001-storyboard-finalize-uses-refine-vocabulary @schema-v3.1 @v3.1 @proposal @refine @finalize-action
  Scenario: Finalize action is encoded as a refine entry with action "finalize" (vocabulary lock)
    Given a refine entry with scope "proposal", a proposal_id, and action "finalize"
    When the system validates the refine entry
    Then the entry should be accepted as valid (ask is ignored for finalize action)
    # The protocol expresses proposal finalization through the existing refine vocabulary
    # rather than introducing a separate finalize endpoint. The refine entry uses
    # scope=proposal, the captured proposal_id, and action=finalize; ask is ignored
    # for the finalize action (mirrors the existing INV-10 pattern for omit action).
    # proposal_finalize: vocabulary lock -- finalize is expressed via the existing refine grammar

  @T-UC-001-inv-210 @invariant @BR-RULE-210 @v3.1 @federation @schema-v3.1
  Scenario: BR-RULE-210 INV-3 holds - canonical agent_url matches an authorized agent
    Given a get_products response references a product sold by a different seller via seller-agent-ref
    And the reference's agent_url canonicalizes to an entry in the publisher's adagents.json authorized_agents[].url
    When the system resolves the seller agent reference
    Then the seller agent reference should be accepted as authorized
    # INV-3 holds: canonical agent_url matches authorized_agents entry
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/get-products-request.json

  @T-UC-001-inv-210-reject @invariant @BR-RULE-210 @error @v3.1 @federation @schema-v3.1
  Scenario Outline: BR-RULE-210 seller-agent-ref rejected - <condition>
    Given a get_products response references a product via seller-agent-ref
    When the seller agent reference is in the <condition> state
    Then the federation reference should be rejected with "seller_not_authorized"
    And the error should include a "suggestion" field
    # INV-1 (uncanonicalizable), INV-2 (no match), INV-4 (non-https), INV-5 (missing url), INV-6 (id slot) -> seller_not_authorized
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/get-products-request.json

    Examples: Rejection conditions
      | condition                                                             |
      | agent_url not canonicalizable (malformed authority / raw non-ToASCII host) |
      | canonical agent_url matches no authorized_agents[].url entry          |
      | agent_url uses http:// scheme against an https:// authorized entry    |
      | required agent_url absent from the reference                          |
      | reserved id slot populated by the sender (agent_url is sole authority)|

  @T-UC-001-boundary-agent-url @boundary @agent_url @v3.1 @federation @schema-v3.1
  Scenario Outline: agent_url canonicalization boundary validation - <boundary_point>
    Given a get_products response references a product via seller-agent-ref
    When the agent_url is at boundary <boundary_point>
    Then the federation authorization result should be <outcome>

    Examples: Boundary values
      | boundary_point                                                       | outcome   |
      | agent_url canonicalizes to a registered authorized_agents[].url      | valid     |
      | uppercase scheme + explicit default port canonicalizes to registered form | valid |
      | correctly ToASCII-normalized IDN host matches registered A-label     | valid     |
      | canonical form present in registry but for a different property      | invalid   |
      | http:// caller against https:// registered entry                    | invalid   |
      | scheme other than https://                                          | invalid   |
      | malformed authority / non-ToASCII host / IPv6 zone id                | invalid   |
      | reserved id slot populated                                          | invalid   |
      | agent_url absent                                                    | invalid   |
