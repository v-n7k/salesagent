Feature: BR-UC-004 Deliver Media Buy Metrics
  As a Buyer (Human or AI Agent)
  I want to retrieve delivery performance metrics for my media buys
  So that I can monitor campaign performance and make optimization decisions

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows the delivery performance of each requested media buy
  #   POST-S2: Buyer can see package-level breakdowns
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows the reporting period covered
  #   POST-S4: Buyer can see aggregated totals across media buys
  #   POST-S5: Buyer knows the current status of each media buy
  #   POST-S6: Buyer receives an unambiguous success confirmation
  #   POST-S7: Buyer's endpoint receives periodic delivery reports
  #   POST-S8: Buyer can verify report authenticity via HMAC signature
  #   POST-S9: Buyer knows the notification type
  #   POST-S10: Buyer knows the sequence number
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on failure
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what failed and the specific error code
  #   POST-F3: Buyer knows how to fix the issue and retry

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant exists with completed setup checklist
    And the Buyer is authenticated
    And the principal "buyer-001" exists in the tenant database



  @T-UC-004-main @main-flow @polling
  Scenario: Polling delivery metrics for a single media buy
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001" with status "active"
    And the ad server adapter has delivery data for "mb-001"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics for media_buy_ids ["mb-001"]
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response status should be "completed"
    And the response should include delivery data for "mb-001"
    And the delivery data should include impressions, spend, and clicks
    And the delivery data should include package-level breakdowns
    And the response should include the reporting period start and end dates
    And the response should include the media buy status "active"
    # POST-S1: Buyer knows delivery performance
    # POST-S2: Package-level breakdowns present
    # POST-S3: Reporting period present
    # POST-S5: Media buy status present
    # POST-S6: Unambiguous success (status=completed)

  @T-UC-004-main-multi @main-flow @polling @post-s4
  Scenario: Polling delivery metrics for multiple media buys with aggregated totals
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001" with status "active"
    And a media buy "mb-002" owned by "buyer-001" with status "active"
    And the ad server adapter has delivery data for both media buys
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics for media_buy_ids ["mb-001", "mb-002"]
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response should include delivery data for "mb-001" and "mb-002"
    And the response should include aggregated totals across both media buys
    And the aggregated impressions should equal the sum of individual impressions
    And the aggregated spend should equal the sum of individual spend
    # POST-S1: Per-media-buy delivery data
    # POST-S4: Aggregated totals across media buys

  @T-UC-004-identify-mode @invariant @BR-RULE-030 @identification
  Scenario Outline: Identification mode resolution - <mode>
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001"
    And the ad server adapter has delivery data for "mb-001"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics with <request_params>
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response should include delivery data for "mb-001"
    # BR-RULE-030: <invariant>

    Examples: Identification priority
      | mode | request_params | invariant |
      | media_buy_ids only | media_buy_ids=["mb-001"] | INV-1: resolves by publisher IDs |

  @T-UC-004-identify-fallback @invariant @BR-RULE-030 @identification
  Scenario: Neither identifiers provided - returns all principal's media buys
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001"
    And a media buy "mb-002" owned by "buyer-001"
    And the ad server adapter has delivery data for both media buys
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics without media_buy_ids
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response should include delivery data for "mb-001" and "mb-002"
    # BR-RULE-030 INV-4: neither provided -> all principal's buys

  @T-UC-004-identify-partial @invariant @BR-RULE-030 @identification
  Scenario: Partial resolution - some IDs valid, some invalid
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001"
    And no media buy exists with id "mb-999"
    And the ad server adapter has delivery data for "mb-001"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics for media_buy_ids ["mb-001", "mb-999"]
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response should include delivery data for "mb-001" only
    And the response errors include code "MEDIA_BUY_NOT_FOUND" for media buy "mb-999"
    And the response should not include an error for "mb-001"
    # BR-RULE-030 INV-5: partial resolution is ADVISORY PER ID — the resolved buy is
    # reported and the unresolved id is named in errors[], which
    # get-media-buy-delivery-response.json (AdCP 3.1.1) declares for exactly this:
    # "Task-specific errors and warnings (e.g., missing delivery data, reporting
    # platform issues)". A buyer that asked about an id gets an answer about it, and
    # the ids that did deliver carry no advisory of their own.

  @T-UC-004-identify-zero @invariant @BR-RULE-030 @identification
  Scenario: Zero resolution - all IDs invalid returns empty array
    Given no media buy exists with id "mb-999" or "mb-998"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics for media_buy_ids ["mb-999", "mb-998"]
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response should have an empty media_buy_deliveries array
    And the response status should be "completed"
    # BR-RULE-030 INV-6: zero resolution -> empty array, no error
    # NOTE: Tension with ext-c which says error. BR-030 (code-derived) takes precedence.

  @T-UC-004-identify-fallback-empty @invariant @BR-RULE-030 @identification
  Scenario: Neither identifiers AND no media buys for principal - empty array
    Given the principal "buyer-001" has no media buys
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics without media_buy_ids
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response should have an empty media_buy_deliveries array
    And the response status should be "completed"
    # BR-RULE-030 INV-4 counter-example: neither provided, no buys -> empty

  @T-UC-004-identify-batch-ownership @invariant @ownership @BR-RULE-030 @identification
  Scenario: Batch request with mixed ownership - non-owned reported as not found
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001"
    And a media buy "mb-other" owned by "other-buyer"
    And the ad server adapter has delivery data for "mb-001"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics for media_buy_ids ["mb-001", "mb-other"]
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response should include delivery data for "mb-001" only
    And the response should NOT include delivery data for "mb-other"
    And the response errors include code "MEDIA_BUY_NOT_FOUND" for media buy "mb-other"
    And the response should not include an error for "mb-001"
    # PRE-BIZ3 (ownership) + BR-RULE-030 INV-5: a non-owned id is answered the same way a
    # nonexistent one is — no delivery data, and MEDIA_BUY_NOT_FOUND in the errors[] that
    # get-media-buy-delivery-response.json (AdCP 3.1.1) declares for "missing delivery
    # data". One code for both cases is what keeps the response from disclosing that
    # someone else's buy exists.

  @T-UC-004-identify-empty @invariant @BR-RULE-030 @error @boundary
  Scenario: Empty array provided - schema rejects request
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics with media_buy_ids []
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the operation should fail
    And the error code should be "INVALID_REQUEST"
    And the error field should contain "media_buy_ids"
    # An empty array violates minItems -- a SCHEMA CONSTRAINT, which the pin maps to
    # INVALID_REQUEST, not VALIDATION_ERROR ("beyond schema validation"). The
    # lowercase "validation_error" was not an emittable code at all. The
    # message-contains-"minItems" assertion is gone with it: the sentence is derived
    # from the code (ADR-010) and cannot name a JSON-Schema keyword.
    And the error should include "suggestion" field
    # Traces to BR-RULE-030 INV-1/INV-2 (schema minItems constraint on identification arrays)
    # POST-F2: Error explains what failed
    # POST-F3: Suggestion for recovery

  @T-UC-004-filter @alternative @status-filter
  Scenario Outline: Status filter - <filter_value>
    # Seed one buy per canonical status (active, completed, paused, rejected,
    # canceled, pending_creatives, pending_start) so EVERY Examples row has a
    # matching buy to return. Seeding only active/completed/paused made the
    # pending_*/rejected/canceled rows return empty, so the Then's loop never ran
    # and the row passed vacuously (#1545 review).
    Given multiple media buys owned by "buyer-001" in various statuses
    And the ad server adapter has delivery data for all media buys
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics with status_filter "<filter_value>"
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response should include only media buys with status "<filter_value>"

    Examples: Valid status values
      | filter_value |
      | pending_creatives |
      | pending_start |
      | active |
      | paused |
      | completed |
      | rejected |
      | canceled |

  @T-UC-004-filter-empty @alternative @status-filter
  Scenario: Status filter - no matches returns empty success
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001" with status "active"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics with status_filter "completed"
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response should have an empty media_buy_deliveries array
    And the response status should be "completed"

  @T-UC-004-filter-invalid @alternative @status-filter @error
  Scenario: Invalid status filter value - rejected
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics with status_filter "nonexistent_status"
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the operation should fail
    And the error code should be "INVALID_REQUEST"
    And the error field should contain "status_filter"
    # Out-of-enum value -> schema constraint -> INVALID_REQUEST. WHICH parameter
    # failed travels on error.field, not in the sentence.
    And the error should include "suggestion" field
    # PRE-BIZ5: status_filter must be a valid value
    # POST-F2: Error explains invalid filter
    # POST-F3: Suggestion lists valid values

  @T-UC-004-filter-default @alternative @status-filter
  Scenario: Default status filter is "active" when not specified
    Given a media buy "mb-active" owned by "buyer-001" with status "active"
    And a media buy "mb-completed" owned by "buyer-001" with status "completed"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics without status_filter
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response should include delivery data for "mb-active" only
    # Constraint YAML: default "active"

  @T-UC-004-filter-array @alternative @status-filter
  Scenario: Status filter with array of multiple statuses
    Given a media buy "mb-active" owned by "buyer-001" with status "active"
    And a media buy "mb-paused" owned by "buyer-001" with status "paused"
    And a media buy "mb-completed" owned by "buyer-001" with status "completed"
    And the ad server adapter has delivery data for all media buys
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics with status_filter ["active", "paused"]
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response should include delivery data for "mb-active" and "mb-paused"
    And the response should not include delivery data for "mb-completed"

  @T-UC-004-daterange @alternative @date-range
  Scenario: Custom date range used as reporting period
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001"
    And the ad server adapter has delivery data for "mb-001"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics with start_date "2026-01-01" and end_date "2026-01-31"
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response reporting_period start should be "2026-01-01"
    And the response reporting_period end should be "2026-01-31"
    # POST-S3: Buyer knows the exact reporting period

  @T-UC-004-daterange-start-only @alternative @date-range
  Scenario: Only start_date provided - end defaults to current date
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001"
    And the ad server adapter has delivery data for "mb-001"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics with start_date "2026-01-01" and no end_date
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response reporting_period end should be today's date

  @T-UC-004-daterange-end-only @alternative @date-range
  Scenario: Only end_date provided - start defaults to media buy creation date
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001" created on "2025-12-01"
    And the ad server adapter has delivery data for "mb-001"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics with end_date "2026-01-31" and no start_date
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
    And the response reporting_period start should be "2025-12-01"
    # NOTE: Schema says creation date default, code says 30 days ago (Gap G40)

  @T-UC-004-daterange-invalid @extension @ext-e @error @invariant @BR-RULE-013 @date-range
  Scenario: Invalid date range - start after end
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics with start_date "2026-02-01" and end_date "2026-01-01"
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the operation should fail
    And the error code should be "invalid_date_range"
    And the error should include "suggestion" field
    # POST-F1: System state unchanged
    # POST-F2: Error explains invalid date range
    # POST-F3: Suggestion for recovery
    # BR-RULE-013 INV-3: end <= start -> rejected

  @T-UC-004-daterange-equal @extension @ext-e @error @invariant @BR-RULE-013 @date-range @boundary
  Scenario: Invalid date range - start equals end (zero-length period)
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001"
    When the Buyer Agent requests delivery metrics with start_date "2026-01-15" and end_date "2026-01-15"
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the operation should fail
    And the error code should be "invalid_date_range"
    And the error should include "suggestion" field
    # BR-RULE-013 INV-3: end <= start -> rejected (boundary: equal dates)

  @T-UC-004-webhook-scheduled @alternative @webhook @post-s7
  Scenario: Scheduled webhook delivery at configured frequency
    Given a media buy "mb-001" with an active reporting_webhook configured
    And the reporting_frequency is "daily"
    And the ad server adapter has delivery data for "mb-001"
    When the webhook scheduler fires for "mb-001"
    Then the webhook payload is compliant with the AdCP delivery webhook spec
    And the system should POST a delivery report to the configured webhook URL
    And the payload should include delivery metrics for "mb-001"
    And the payload should include the reporting_period
    # POST-S7: Buyer's endpoint receives periodic delivery reports

  @T-UC-004-webhook-hmac @alternative @webhook @invariant @BR-RULE-029 @post-s8 @nfr @nfr-005
  Scenario: HMAC-SHA256 signed webhook payload
    Given a media buy "mb-001" with webhook authentication scheme "HMAC-SHA256"
    And the shared secret is a valid 32+ character string
    When the system delivers a webhook report for "mb-001"
    Then the webhook payload is compliant with the AdCP delivery webhook spec
    And the request should include header "X-ADCP-Signature" with hex-encoded HMAC
    And the request should include header "X-ADCP-Timestamp" with a UNIX timestamp
    And the HMAC should be computed over "timestamp.payload" concatenation
    # POST-S8: Buyer can verify report authenticity
    # BR-RULE-029 INV-1: monotonically increasing sequence (signing is precondition)
    # Webhook auth: traces to SR-NFR-005

  @T-UC-004-webhook-9421 @alternative @webhook @invariant @BR-RULE-029 @post-s8 @nfr @nfr-005
  Scenario: RFC 9421 signed webhook payload when no authentication block is registered
    # The mutually exclusive TWIN of @T-UC-004-webhook-hmac, not an addition to it.
    # security.mdx @ v3.1.1 :1424 — the buyer's `authentication` block is the mode
    # switch: present selects legacy HMAC/Bearer, ABSENT selects RFC 9421. ":1425
    # Sellers MUST NOT sign the same webhook both ways", which is why the last Then
    # is here: a delivery carrying both signatures would satisfy this scenario's
    # positive clauses and still be non-conformant.
    Given a media buy "mb-001" with an active reporting_webhook configured
    And the reporting_webhook registers no authentication block
    And the tenant publishes an RFC 9421 webhook signing key
    When the system delivers a webhook report for "mb-001"
    Then the request should include header "Signature"
    And the request should include header "Signature-Input"
    And the request should include header "Content-Digest"
    And the Signature-Input tag should equal the advertised webhook_signing profile
    And the covered components should include "content-digest"
    And the signature should verify against the tenant's published JWKS
    And the request should not include header "X-ADCP-Signature"
    # POST-S8: Buyer can verify report authenticity — here by resolving our published
    # JWKS rather than by sharing a secret out of band.
    # Webhook auth: traces to SR-NFR-005

  @T-UC-004-webhook-bearer @alternative @webhook @invariant @BR-RULE-029
  Scenario: Bearer token webhook authentication
    Given a media buy "mb-001" with webhook authentication scheme "Bearer"
    And the bearer token is a valid 32+ character string
    When the system delivers a webhook report for "mb-001"
    Then the webhook payload is compliant with the AdCP delivery webhook spec
    And the request should include header "Authorization" with the bearer token
    # Webhook auth: traces to SR-NFR-005

  @T-UC-004-webhook-notification-type @alternative @webhook @invariant @BR-RULE-029 @post-s9
  Scenario Outline: Webhook notification type - <type>
    Given a media buy "mb-001" with an active reporting_webhook
    When the system delivers a "<type>" webhook report for "mb-001"
    Then the webhook payload is compliant with the AdCP delivery webhook spec
    And the payload notification_type should be "<type>"
    And the payload <next_expected> include next_expected_at
    # This webhook registers no authentication block either, so :1424 selects the same
    # RFC 9421 arm as @T-UC-004-webhook-9421 — but no key was provisioned for it, and
    # an unpublishable origin means the delivery must go out UNSIGNED rather than
    # carrying a signature no receiver could resolve a key for. Asserted here because
    # the sibling's key provisioning is a PER-SCENARIO opt-in: if it ever becomes an
    # env default, every scenario on this page silently changes posture and this is
    # the line that says so.
    And the request should not include header "Signature"
    # POST-S9: Buyer knows the notification type
    # BR-RULE-029 INV-2: final -> no next_expected_at

    Examples: Notification types and next_expected_at presence
      | type | next_expected |
      | scheduled | should |
      | final | should not |
      | delayed | should |
      | adjusted | should |

  @T-UC-004-webhook-sequence @alternative @webhook @invariant @BR-RULE-029 @post-s10
  Scenario: Webhook sequence numbers are monotonically increasing
    Given a media buy "mb-001" with an active reporting_webhook
    When the system delivers three consecutive webhook reports for "mb-001"
    Then the webhook payload is compliant with the AdCP delivery webhook spec
    And each report should have a higher sequence_number than the previous
    And the first sequence_number should be >= 1
    # POST-S10: Buyer knows the sequence number for ordering
    # BR-RULE-029 INV-1: monotonically increasing per media buy stream

  @T-UC-004-webhook-no-aggregated @alternative @webhook
  Scenario: Webhook payload does not include aggregated totals
    Given a media buy "mb-001" with an active reporting_webhook
    When the system delivers a webhook report for "mb-001"
    Then the webhook payload is compliant with the AdCP delivery webhook spec
    And the payload should not include "aggregated_totals" field
    # UC-004 note: aggregated totals are polling-only (not webhook)

  @T-UC-004-webhook-retry-5xx @async @extension @ext-g @webhook-reliability @invariant @BR-RULE-029 @nfr @nfr-005
  Scenario: Webhook delivery retries on 5xx response
    Given a media buy "mb-001" with an active reporting_webhook
    And the webhook endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error
    When the system attempts to deliver a webhook report
    Then the webhook payload is compliant with the AdCP delivery webhook spec
    And the payload notification_type should be "scheduled"
    And the system should retry up to 3 times
    And retries should use exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s + jitter)
    # BR-RULE-029 INV-3: 5xx -> retry with exponential backoff
    # POST-F2: System knows the failure mode
    # The BODY is graded too: a retry scenario that grades only the retry COUNT
    # passes just as happily when the thing being retried is malformed.

  @T-UC-004-webhook-retry-network @async @extension @ext-g @webhook-reliability @invariant @BR-RULE-029
  Scenario: Webhook delivery retries on network error
    Given a media buy "mb-001" with an active reporting_webhook
    And the webhook endpoint is unreachable (connection timeout)
    When the system attempts to deliver a webhook report
    # A body DOES reach the wire here: the origin accepts the request and records it
    # before closing without responding (local_http_origin.close_without_responding),
    # so "unreachable" is a response-level failure, not a connect-level one.
    Then the webhook payload is compliant with the AdCP delivery webhook spec
    And the payload notification_type should be "scheduled"
    And the system should retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
    # BR-RULE-029 INV-3: network error -> retry

  @T-UC-004-webhook-no-retry-4xx @async @extension @ext-g @webhook-reliability @invariant @BR-RULE-029
  Scenario: Webhook delivery does not retry on 4xx response
    Given a media buy "mb-001" with an active reporting_webhook
    And the webhook endpoint returns 401 Unauthorized
    When the system attempts to deliver a webhook report
    Then the webhook payload is compliant with the AdCP delivery webhook spec
    And the payload notification_type should be "scheduled"
    And the system should not retry the delivery
    And the system should log the authentication rejection
    And the webhook should be marked as failed
    # BR-RULE-029 INV-4: 4xx -> no retry (client error)

  @T-UC-004-webhook-circuit-open @async @extension @ext-g @webhook-reliability @nfr @nfr-005
  Scenario: Persistent webhook failures open circuit breaker
    Given a media buy "mb-001" with an active reporting_webhook
    And the webhook endpoint has failed 5 consecutive delivery attempts
    When the system evaluates the circuit breaker state
    # NO body reaches the wire: 5 failures hits failure_threshold, so send_delivery_webhook
    # returns at `if not circuit_breaker.can_attempt()` before dialling. The skip is the
    # OPEN breaker, not a missing config — a reporting_webhook is registered above.
    Then the webhook delivery should be skipped without an HTTP POST
    And the circuit breaker should transition to "OPEN"
    And subsequent scheduled deliveries should be suppressed
    # POST-F2: System knows the webhook is persistently failing

  # LOCALLY CORRECTED (salesagent-sq8ib.10): the first Given was missing, so this
  # scenario asserted a DELIVERY claim with no webhook registered. Without a
  # PushNotificationConfig the sender returns False before the breaker is ever
  # consulted, so "the system should attempt a single probe delivery" could only
  # ever be graded against a test double -- which is what it was, via a
  # pytest.xfail on a branch that could not execute. Both siblings
  # (@T-UC-004-webhook-circuit-open, @T-UC-004-webhook-circuit-recovery) already
  # carry this Given verbatim; this one was the odd scenario out. Reconcile
  # upstream in adcp-req.
  @T-UC-004-webhook-circuit-halfopen @async @extension @ext-g @webhook-reliability
  Scenario: Circuit breaker half-open probe attempts recovery
    Given a media buy "mb-001" with an active reporting_webhook
    And a media buy "mb-001" with circuit breaker in "OPEN" state
    And the circuit breaker timeout (60s) has elapsed

    Given a media buy "mb-001" with an active reporting_webhook
    And the outbound webhook URL is blocked by SSRF validation

    # Corrected on two counts. The code was spelled "media_buy_not_found"; the pin's 92

  # RETIRED 2026-09-15: @T-UC-004-partition-sampling and @T-UC-004-boundary-sampling,
  # "Sampling method partition/boundary". Both graded a request field that AdCP 3.1.1
  # does not have. `sampling_method` appears NOWHERE in the pinned schemas (zero hits
  # across _schemas/3.1/), get-media-buy-delivery-request.json declares twelve
  # properties and none of them is it, and no pinned enum anywhere carries
  # random / stratified / recent / systematic. So the outlines' own "valid" rows
  # demanded this seller ACCEPT an invented field, and their "invalid" row demanded a
  # refusal the spec never asks for.
  #
  # They passed anyway, for a reason that hid the defect: the DTO declares no
  # `sampling_method`, so the accepted-shape strip rejects it as an UNDECLARED field
  # with INVALID_REQUEST (CLAUDE.md pattern 7, a repo policy rather than a spec
  # obligation). That is the identical rejection the four "valid" rows received, so
  # the Then could not tell "this enum value is refused" from "this field does not
  # exist" -- and the emitted issue says so literally, keyword `additionalProperties`
  # on pointer `/sampling_method`.
  #
  # Deleted rather than corrected, because there is no pinned obligation to correct
  # them toward. The one real sampling concept in the pin is `failures_only`, a
  # BOOLEAN filter on content-standards/get-media-buy-artifacts-request.json -- a
  # different tool -- and it is already graded at BR-UC-024-content-compliance.feature
  # (BR-RULE-185 INV-3 and the partition rows beneath it). No coverage is lost here.

  Scenario: Measurement accountability -- required_metrics declared at discovery surfaces missing_metrics in delivery
    Given the buyer declared filters.required_metrics including "completed_views" at get_products time
    And the seller filtered products to those whose reporting_capabilities.available_metrics is a superset of required_metrics
    And the buyer created a media buy from one of those products
    And controller-driven simulated delivery emitted impressions but did not emit "completed_views"

    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec

  Scenario Outline: media_buy status boundary - <boundary_point>
    Given a media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001"
    When the response reports media buy status at boundary "<boundary_point>"

  Scenario Outline: measurement_window boundary - <boundary_point>
    Given delivery data for media buy "mb-001" owned by "buyer-001"
    When the seller emits a report at measurement_window boundary "<boundary_point>"
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec

  Scenario Outline: aggregated_totals reach boundary - <boundary_point>
    Given delivery data for media buys owned by "buyer-001"
    When the seller assembles aggregated_totals reach fields at boundary "<boundary_point>"
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buy_delivery spec
