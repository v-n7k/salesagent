Feature: BR-UC-021 Preview Creative
  As a Buyer (or Buyer Agent)
  I want to generate visual previews of creative manifests in single, batch, or variant mode
  So that I can verify how ads will render before committing them to a media buy

    Then results[0] renders contain preview_html (overridden to html)
    And results[1] renders contain preview_url (batch default url)
    # BR-RULE-162 INV-6: Batch output_format is default; per-item overrides it

    When the Buyer Agent invokes preview_creative with request_type "variant"
    Then the response may or may not include an expires_at timestamp
    And the variant preview is still valid regardless of expires_at presence

  @T-UC-021-storyboard-preview-display-from-synced-manifest @schema-v3.1 @v3-1 @preview-from-library
  Scenario: Preview a synced display creative -- returns preview_url and render_dimensions matching the format
    Given a display creative has been synced to the library with creative_id "display_trail_pro_300x250" and format_id {agent_url, "display_300x250"}
    When the Buyer Agent sends preview_creative with request_type "single" and the synced creative_manifest
    Then the response is compliant with the preview_creative singleresponse spec
    And the response should carry a preview_url the buyer can inspect
    And the render_dimensions on the preview should match the format_id "display_300x250"
    # creative_lifecycle preview_display: the buyer requests a preview of a
    # display creative that was previously synced (creative_id present). The
    # platform returns a preview_url the buyer can inspect along with
    # render_dimensions matching the format (300x250 in the storyboard's
    # canonical example). This anchors the post-sync preview flow as distinct
    # from the existing single/batch/variant inline scenarios.
    # preview_display: post-sync preview returns a render in the format's native dimensions
