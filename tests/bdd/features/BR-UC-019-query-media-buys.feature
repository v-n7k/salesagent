Feature: BR-UC-019 Query Media Buys
  As a Buyer (Human or AI Agent)
  I want to query the current state of my media buys
  So that I can monitor campaign status, check creative approvals, and assess delivery pacing

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows the current status of each matching media buy (v3.1 MediaBuyStatus: pending_creatives, pending_start, active, paused, completed, rejected, canceled)
  #   POST-S2: Buyer knows the package-level details for each media buy (budget, bid_price, product, flight dates, paused state)
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows the creative approval state for each package (pending_review, approved, rejected with reason)
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows the near-real-time delivery metrics per package when snapshots were requested and available
  #   POST-S5: Buyer knows why a snapshot is unavailable when requested but not returned
  #   POST-S6: Buyer can correlate results via v3.1 lifecycle handles (revision, valid_actions, history, cancellation, echoed account/invoice_recipient)
  #   POST-F1: Buyer knows the operation failed
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what went wrong (error explains the failure)
  #   POST-F3: Buyer knows how to recover (error includes recovery classification)

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And the Buyer is authenticated
    And the principal "buyer-001" exists in the tenant database







  @T-UC-019-main @main-flow
  Scenario: Query media buys with default filters
    Given the principal "buyer-001" owns media buy "mb-001" with start_date "2026-03-01" and end_date "2026-03-31"
    And today is "2026-03-15"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request with no filters
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buys spec
    And the response should include media buy "mb-001" with status "active"
    And each media buy should include package-level details with budget, bid_price, product_id, flight dates, and paused state
    And each package should include creative approval state when creatives are assigned
    And each media buy should include buyer_campaign_ref for correlation
    # POST-S1: Status computed from flight dates
    # POST-S2: Package-level details present
    # POST-S3: Creative approval state present
    # POST-S6: buyer_campaign_ref present for correlation

  @T-UC-019-envelope-status @envelope @schema @v3-1
  Scenario: A get_media_buys response carries the spec-required envelope status
    # HAND-EDITED, and the COMMENT form deliberately rather than the @hand-edited tag.
    # This scenario currently has an upstream twin in adcp-req, so the pair classifies
    # NO-OP and is preserved — the marker changes nothing today. It exists for the day
    # the twin is removed upstream: without it the pair becomes `target is None` and
    # compile_bdd.py:1028 classifies LEGACY-DELETE, silently dropping this PR's principal
    # envelope oracle on a regeneration nobody is watching. Measured against the real
    # adcp-req checkout: with the twin stripped, the scenario is DELETED from the merged
    # output, not failed.
    #
    # The tag form would earn the same marker and break the present: local tags are
    # compared by _tags_match_ignoring_id, so an extra @hand-edited desynchronises
    # legacy.tags from target.tags and flips a clean NO-OP into NEEDS-SEMANTIC-MERGE on
    # EVERY regeneration. The tag is right for a scenario with no twin -- see
    # @T-UC-019-listing-omits-unrenderable-row and
    # @T-UC-019-confirmed-at-null-survives-exclude-none, cited by TAG rather than by
    # line because this very comment shifted both of them when it was inserted;
    # it is wrong for this one. Same marker, opposite correct form, decided by whether a
    # twin exists.
    Given the principal "buyer-001" owns media buy "mb-001" with start_date "2026-03-01" and end_date "2026-03-31"
    And today is "2026-03-15"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request with no filters
    Then the response envelope carries status completed
    And the response is compliant with the get_media_buys spec
    # core/protocol-envelope.json marks `status` REQUIRED on every task response
    # envelope, and get-media-buys-response.json composes that branch via a top-level
    # allOf — so the requirement reaches this response through composition rather
    # than by being spelled out on it. That is exactly how it went missing in a
    # real implementation: the response type declared no status at all and no
    # transport noticed, because nothing graded the composed branch.

  @T-UC-019-main-filter-ids @main-flow @filtering
  Scenario: Query media buys by specific media_buy_ids
    Given the principal "buyer-001" owns media buys "mb-001", "mb-002", and "mb-003"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request for media_buy_ids ["mb-001", "mb-003"]
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buys spec
    And the response should include media buys "mb-001" and "mb-003"
    And the response should not include media buy "mb-002"
    # POST-S1: Status present for each requested buy

  @T-UC-019-main-snapshot @main-flow @snapshot
  Scenario: Query media buys with delivery snapshots requested and available
    Given the principal "buyer-001" owns media buy "mb-001" with package "pkg-001"
    And the ad platform adapter supports realtime reporting
    And snapshot data is available for package "pkg-001"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request with include_snapshot true
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buys spec
    And package "pkg-001" should include a snapshot
    And the snapshot should include as_of, staleness_seconds, impressions, and spend
    # POST-S4: Near-real-time delivery metrics present per package

  @T-UC-019-main-no-results @main-flow
  Scenario: Query returns empty results when principal has no matching media buys
    Given an authenticated principal "buyer-001" who owns no media buys
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request with no filters
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buys spec
    And the response should include an empty media_buys array
    And no error should be present in the response
    # POST-S1: Empty result is valid (no matching buys)

  @T-UC-019-ext-a @extension @ext-a @error
  Scenario: Authentication required - identity missing from request
    Given the Buyer has no authentication credentials
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request without authentication
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the operation should fail with error code "AUTH_MISSING"
    And the error should include a "recovery" field indicating correctable failure
    And the error should include a "suggestion" field
    # POST-F1: Buyer knows the operation failed
    # POST-F2: Error explains authentication is missing
    # POST-F3: Recovery classification indicates how to fix

  # REMOVED: "Principal ID missing - identity resolved but principal_id absent".
  #
  # It asked for an identity that is resolved and carries no principal, answered with an
  # empty media_buys array and an errors[] entry coded "principal_id_missing". Three
  # independent reasons, each checkable:
  #
  # 1. The state is unconstructible. get_media_buys declares ResolvedIdentity
  #    (src/core/tools/media_buy_list.py:147), on which the principal is not optional, so
  #    "resolved but without a principal" is not a state the boundary can hand a tool. The
  #    harness said so directly: the Given failed constructing Principal with
  #    principal_id=None, and the run reported it as MISCLASSIFIED strict-xfail — wiring
  #    dormancy recorded as a production gap.
  # 2. The code is not in the protocol. adcp 3.1.1 enums/error-code.json declares 92 codes,
  #    none containing "PRINCIPAL", and every one is upper snake case; "principal_id_missing"
  #    is neither a member nor the shape of a member. No site under src/ emits it.
  # 3. The shape contradicts the pin. An empty array beside an advisory is a success
  #    document; the two refusals the pin defines for this situation carry recoveries that
  #    forbid reading them that way — AUTH_INVALID is terminal, AUTH_MISSING correctable.
  #
  # The real behaviour it was reaching for is graded, on every transport, by the principal
  # scoping boundary outline below: a presented credential that resolves to no principal is
  # refused hard with AUTH_INVALID, and no credential at all with AUTH_MISSING.
    # POST-F3: Buyer can infer corrective action

  # REMOVED: "Principal not found - principal_id not in registry".
  #
  # It is the same state as the principal scoping boundary row "credentials presented but
  # not resolvable" — a credential that verifies against no principal row — and asked for
  # the opposite answer: a compliant get_media_buys response, an empty media_buys array,
  # and an errors[] entry coded "principal_not_found". Both halves contradict adcp 3.1.1.
  #
  # 1. The code is not in the protocol. enums/error-code.json declares 92 codes, none
  #    containing "PRINCIPAL", and every one is upper snake case. No site under src/
  #    emits "principal_not_found".
  # 2. The shape contradicts the pin's own recovery. The refusal the pin defines for a
  #    presented-and-rejected credential is AUTH_INVALID with recovery "terminal" and the
  #    suggestion "do NOT auto-retry"; an empty array beside an advisory is a success
  #    document, which a buyer may legitimately retry and reconcile against.
  # 3. The Given could only reach that shape by injecting a fabricated identity into the
  #    request kwargs, bypassing the resolver — the simulated-identity path this epic
  #    removed with the IMPL transport.
  #
  # The behaviour it was reaching for is graded, on every transport, by the principal
  # scoping boundary outline below.

  Scenario: Request validation failed - invalid parameter values
    Given the Buyer is authenticated
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request with invalid parameter types
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the operation should fail with error code "INVALID_REQUEST"
    And the error message should include field-level validation details
    And the error should include a "recovery" field indicating correctable failure
    And the error should include a "suggestion" field
    # POST-F1: Buyer knows the operation failed
    # POST-F2: Error identifies which fields failed validation
    # POST-F3: Per-field details enable targeted correction

  @T-UC-019-ext-e @extension @ext-e
  Scenario: A request carrying an account is accepted and scoped to it
    Given the Buyer is authenticated
    # The account must RESOLVE, or this scenario cannot grade what it names. The seller
    # resolves the account a request carries before running the tool, so an unseeded id
    # fails with ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND -- a correct answer to a different question.
    And the Buyer has access to an account
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request with that account_id
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buys spec
    And the response should succeed
    # get-media-buys-request.json declares `account` as an optional property, so a
    # buyer sending one is conformant and the seller must accept it. Every other tool
    # that declares the field accepts it -- it is REQUIRED on create_media_buy,
    # update_media_buy and sync_creatives, and optional-and-accepted on
    # get_media_buy_delivery, get_products, get_task_status, list_tasks,
    # list_creatives and list_accounts. get_media_buys was the only refusal.

  @T-UC-019-partition-status @partition @status
  Scenario Outline: Status computation from flight dates - <partition>
    Given the principal "buyer-001" owns media buy "mb-001" whose flight window starts <start> and ends <end>
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request for media_buy_ids ["mb-001"]
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buys spec
    And the media buy "mb-001" should have status "<expected_status>"
    # The window is relative to the run date and no clock is pinned, for the reason
    # given on the boundary outline below: a patched datetime never reaches a server
    # running in its own container, so an absolute window graded the calendar rather
    # than the partition.
    # BR-RULE-150: Status computed from relationship between today and flight dates
    # RETIRED (T-UC-019-partition-status-invalid): "Status computation with missing dates".
    # Verified against AdCP 3.1 GA (spec pin v3.1-04f59d2d5): the core media-buy object
    # (dist/schemas/2.5.0/core/media-buy.json) has NO date fields — flight dates are
    # per-package — and `status` is REQUIRED, always emitted from the persisted status
    # column (never computed FROM dates; dates only REFINE a serving window). A media
    # buy with "missing dates" is therefore not a spec-level state. It is also
    # schema-impossible: MediaBuy.start_date/end_date are NOT NULL, so a dateless buy
    # cannot be persisted and get_media_buys can never receive one. This partition was a
    # phantom (its error was synthesized test-side; production was never invoked), so it
    # is retired rather than wired. The latent crash it implied (date compare vs a NULL
    # edge) is fixed defensively in resolve_canonical_status (returns the persisted
    # status, no TypeError). Retired at the source, so the merge does not re-add it.

    Examples: Valid partitions
      | partition                    | start        | end          | expected_status |
      | active_refined_pending_start | in 14 days   | in 30 days   | pending_start   |
      | active_refined_in_flight     | 14 days ago  | in 16 days   | active          |
      | active_refined_completed     | 31 days ago  | 1 day ago    | completed       |
      | single_day_flight            | today        | today        | active          |

  # The flight window is stated RELATIVE to the day the test runs, and the scenario
  # pins no clock. An absolute window obliges the scenario to patch production's
  # datetime, which reaches production only while it shares the test process: over
  # e2e_rest the server runs in its own container on the real clock, so the patch was
  # inert and every row was judged against the calendar instead of against the
  # boundary it names. Three rows then "passed" merely because the real date had
  # drifted past a fixed 2026-03 window, and the other four could not pass at all.
  # Offsets need no clock, so each boundary is graded identically on every transport.
  @T-UC-019-boundary-status @boundary @status
  Scenario Outline: Status computation boundary - <boundary_point>
    Given the principal "buyer-001" owns media buy "mb-001" whose flight window starts <start> and ends <end>
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request for media_buy_ids ["mb-001"]
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buys spec

    # No clock is pinned. The "various statuses" seed builds each window as an offset

    # Two demanded "an authenticated identity with no principal_id" answered with a SOFT
    # AUTH_MISSING and an empty media_buys array. Both halves contradict the pin. Its
    # AUTH_MISSING description reads "No credentials were presented. Sellers MUST return
    # this code when no Authorization header was included in the request", so a caller who
    # HAS presented a credential is never AUTH_MISSING; that is the row below on no
    # authentication context. And the state itself is unconstructible: get_media_buys is a
    # protected tool whose implementation declares ResolvedIdentity
    # (src/core/tools/media_buy_list.py:147), on which the principal is not optional, so the
    # resolver refuses such a caller before the tool runs rather than serving it an empty
    # array. Those two rows described the tenant-admin-token credential class this epic
    # removed, where a token authenticated without naming a buyer.
    #
    # The third demanded a SOFT AUTH_INVALID with an empty array for a credential naming an
    # unknown principal. The code is right and the shape is not: the pin gives AUTH_INVALID
    # recovery "terminal" with the suggestion "do NOT auto-retry", and a terminal refusal is
    # not an empty success. The three collapse into one row: a presented credential that
    # resolves to no principal is refused, hard, before any database access.

    # RETIRED SCENARIO (T-UC-019-inv-150-11): "unknown persisted status defaults to
    # active then flight-refines". It graded the defensive default-to-active path, and
    # that path is deleted.
    #
    # The default was not merely redundant, it was harmful. An unmapped persisted
    # status was reported to the buyer as a SERVING buy, and — once the commitment
    # vocabulary was made fail-closed — with no confirmed_at to go with it. The pinned
    # item schema forbids exactly that pair (confirmed_at is [string, null] with an
    # allOf/if guard that rejects null when status is "active"), so honouring INV-11
    # meant publishing a document that fails its own schema. The scenario passed only
    # because its Then checks the status field alone.
    #
    # Per the owner ruling in the remediation plan's ALTERATIONS section, a closed
    # vocabulary is enforced where values ENTER: MediaBuyRepository now refuses a status
    # outside PersistedMediaBuyStatus at all four write doors (update_status,
    # update_fields, create_from_request, create), so an unmapped value cannot be
    # persisted and the reader no longer has to invent a meaning for one.
    #
    # The obligation this scenario was reaching for — an unmapped status never yields a
    # nonsense buyer-visible state — is graded against a real write in
    # tests/integration/test_media_buy_revision_confirmation.py::
    # test_an_unrecognised_status_is_refused_at_the_write_boundary, and every value the
    # column CAN hold is swept through the projection by
    # tests/unit/test_media_buy_status_consistency.py.
    #
    # BR-RULE-150 INV-11 was reconciled at the source (adcp-req 86a4cde) and
    # regenerated: the invariant as written mandated a defensive default the pinned
    # response schema cannot represent, and now states the enforced refusal instead.

    # BR-RULE-291: the pinned item schema types revision {"type":"integer","minimum":1}
    # and lists it in the item's `required`, so a buy whose persisted revision is
    # below that minimum is NOT publishable — the seller must not put it on the wire.
    # The two defective rows grade that refusal by the code the buyer receives:
    # CONFIGURATION_ERROR / terminal — see the note under this outline.
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/media-buy/get-media-buys-response.json
    # WHY THE TWO DEFECTIVE ROWS NAME CONFIGURATION_ERROR (T-UC-019-boundary-revision)
    # The obligation is that a media buy whose persisted revision is below the pinned
    # minimum is NEVER published to the buyer — and that the refusal names the code the
    # pin's own enumMetadata selects for it.
    #
    # Production used to reject the defective value at the response-model boundary and
    # let the boundary translate the Pydantic failure to VALIDATION_ERROR / recovery
    # "correctable". By the pin (enums/error-code.json) that tells the BUYER to "review
    # error details and fix field values" for a defect in the SELLER's store — data the
    # buyer does not own, cannot fix, and would retry unboundedly. The read path now
    # refuses it as AdCPPersistedStateError -> CONFIGURATION_ERROR / "terminal", whose
    # metadata says to surface it to a human at the seller and MUST NOT auto-retry.
    #
    # The earlier text demanded code "SCHEMA_VIOLATION", which is not in the pinned
    # error-code enum at all — it is conformance-runner vocabulary, never a wire code,
    # so no conforming seller could have emitted it and no grader could have caught
    # its absence. Corrected at the source (adcp-req 86a4cde) and regenerated.
    # RETIRED ROW (T-UC-019-boundary-revision): "revision absent" — a persisted store
    # missing revision (defective seller). Unreachable at BOTH layers, so wiring it
    # would have graded a state no seller running this code can produce:
    #   - persistence: MediaBuy.revision is Integer, nullable=False, default=1,
    #     server_default='1' (src/core/database/models.py:975) with no CHECK constraint —
    #     a row with no revision cannot be written or migrated in.
    #   - wire: GetMediaBuysMediaBuy.revision is a bare `int` (src/core/tools/
    #     media_buy_list.py:47), never None, so the key cannot be omitted from the
    #     response either.
    # The two REACHABLE defective values (0 and -1) stay above and DO grade the
    # schema minimum — retiring this row deletes no coverage. Contrast the
    # confirmed_at outline below, where "missing" IS reachable (nullable column) and
    # is therefore rewritten rather than retired. Retired at the source, so the merge
    # does not re-add it.

    And the principal "buyer-001" owns media buy "mb-broken" with persisted revision 0 (defective seller)
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request with no filters
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buys spec
    And the response should include media buy "mb-good"
    And the response should not include media buy "mb-broken"

    #
    # The sibling T-UC-019-boundary-revision grades the OTHER half of the same policy:
    # when the buyer NAMES the defective row in media_buy_ids, the read refuses with
    # CONFIGURATION_ERROR (ruling R-M1) rather than answering "no such media buy". This
    # row grades the unfiltered listing, where refusing would deny a tenant every buy
    # they own over one corrupt row. Request shape is the discriminator — see
    # _buyer_named_rows in src/core/tools/media_buy_list.py.

    # validate_against_pinned_schema reads: media_buys[].revision is
    # {"type":"integer","minimum":1} and sits in the item's `required`, so persisted 0
    # is unpublishable; and `errors` is a top-level sibling of `media_buys`, so a

    Given the principal "buyer-001" owns media buy "mb-001" with <buy_state>
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request for media_buy_ids ["mb-001"]
    Then the response is compliant with the get_media_buys spec
    And <expected_outcome>
    # POST-S6 / INT-006: confirmed_at presence and ISO 8601 shape
    # RETIRED ROW (T-UC-019-partition-confirmed-at): "confirmed_at_missing_on_buy",
    # briefly rewritten as "confirmed_at_null_column_on_active_buy". Both spellings are
    # gone, and the second one is why this note is long: it was a correct rewrite of a
    # backwards row, retired one lane later because the state it graded stopped
    # existing.
    #
    # "STOPPED EXISTING" IS NOW MEASURED, not asserted. It was written unchecked, and a
    # factory build (MediaBuyFactory.build(status="active", confirmed_at=None)) proves
    # only that the TEST HARNESS can construct the state — a different population from
    # the one this claim is about. Production measured directly:
    #   - two src/ writers of MediaBuy.status, both in repositories/media_buy.py, and
    #     both followed by _stamp_confirmation_if_needed
    #   - ZERO core-DML writes to media_buys anywhere in src/, so nothing bypasses the
    #     ORM stamp
    #   - MediaBuy.__init__ refuses a preset confirmed_at, so a row cannot be born
    #     stamped-wrong
    #   - the backfill migration matches lower(status), so the later lowercase
    #     normalisation cannot strand a row, and its COALESCE(approved_at, created_at)
    #     predicate is always satisfied because created_at is NOT NULL with a default
    # So a seller running this code cannot produce a committed buy with a null
    # confirmed_at. The limit: that covers src/ and the migration chain AS THEY STAND,
    # not a future core-DML status write — the write-seam guard's GUARDED_FIELDS does
    # not include `status`.
    #
    # The original demanded SCHEMA_VIOLATION for an active buy with a null
    # confirmed_at. That graded a BUG's presence: the pinned item schema
    # (media-buy/get-media-buys-response.json) types confirmed_at [string, null] and
    # requires the key, with an allOf/if guard forbidding null only when status is
    # "active" — so the row passed only if a schema-invalid document shipped. It was
    # rewritten to assert the opposite: a schema-valid document carrying a real
    # timestamp, which is what the read-time resolver owed the buyer.
    #
    # That resolver is now DELETED. Per the owner ruling recorded in the remediation
    # plan's ALTERATIONS section, legacy data is corrected by migration rather than by
    # a compatibility path in code: existing rows were backfilled, the repository
    # stamps at every write, and the test factory stamps for confirmed statuses. So an
    # active buy with a null confirmed_at is no longer producible — by production or by
    # a fixture — and the row joins "revision absent" as premise-impossible.
    #
    # The OBLIGATION it carried is not retired and is not weakened. That an active buy
    # reaches the buyer with a non-null confirmed_at is graded by the envelope-status
    # scenario above, which validates the whole document against the same pinned schema
    # and so fires the same allOf/if guard, and by the repository's own stamp tests.
    # What is gone is only the premise. Retired at the source, so the merge does not
    # re-add it.
    #
    # RETIRED ROW: "confirmed_at_not_iso8601" (persisted confirmed_at
    # "2026-05-01 12:00:00", no T, no TZ). Unreachable: the column is
    # DateTime(timezone=True) (models.py:981) and the wire value is a Pydantic
    # datetime, so a non-ISO string can neither be persisted nor round-trip to the
    # response — no seller running this code can emit it. Reconcile both upstream in
    # adcp-req so --merge does not re-add them.

    # SUPERSEDED CODE: this scenario is DORMANT — its Given has no

    # and none of the assertions below has ever executed. Its "SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE" is the
    # defect zkde1.6 fixes: recovery "transient" advises a retry that can never repair a
    # corrupt row in the SELLER's store. The live grader of this advisory's code and
    # recovery is the targeting_overlay row of @T-UC-019-blob-degraded-package-field
    # above, which asserts CONFIGURATION_ERROR / "terminal" off the wire. Wiring the rest
    # of THIS scenario (the logging and "suggestion" obligations it also states) is a
    # separate graduation, deliberately out of zkde1.6's scope.

  # ISOLATION IS THE OBLIGATION, and it was ungraded. The degradation of ONE corrupt
  # package_config cell is graded by @T-UC-019-blob-degraded-package-field below, but
  # that outline seeds one buy with one package, so neither half of the isolation
  # claim — a sibling PACKAGE in the same buy (INV-5), a sibling BUY in the same
  # listing (INV-6) — was covered anywhere. Production could start failing a whole
  # listing over one corrupt sibling and nothing would go red.
  #
  # CODE CORRECTED: these two scenarios demanded a `TARGETING_REHYDRATION_FAILED`
  # advisory. There is no such code. Pinned
  # `adcp/_schemas/3.1/enums/error-code.json` declares 92 codes and that is not one
  # of them, and `Error.code` is typed `ErrorCodeT` (src/core/schemas/_base.py:225),
  # so an advisory carrying it is unconstructible rather than merely non-standard.
  # The code for a corrupt cell in the SELLER's own store is CONFIGURATION_ERROR,
  # recovery "terminal" — settled, with its full reasoning, in the
  # @T-UC-019-blob-degraded-package-field comment block below, which these scenarios
  # now share a Then sentence with rather than restating. What survives of the
  # original sentence is its quantifier: EXACTLY ONE advisory in the whole document,
  # which is the half that grades "isolation" as opposed to "an advisory exists".
  #
  # GEO SPELLING CORRECTED: the valid sibling was spelled `{geo:["US"]}`. Pinned
  # `core/targeting.json` declares no `geo` field at all — the v3 spelling is
  # `geo_countries` (array of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) — and `Targeting` reshapes nothing
  # on the way in, so the flat spelling raises extra_forbidden in dev/CI while
  # rehydrating the SIBLING and fails the whole listing: the exact outcome these
  # scenarios forbid. Same correction as `_VALID_BLOB_SIBLINGS`.

    # THE BLOB RULE. `package_config` is an untyped JSON column, so
    # every value read out of it is a legacy value the current pinned types may reject.
    # The pinned item schema (media-buy/get-media-buys-response.json) lists ONLY
    # `package_id` in packages.items.required, so `product_id` / `start_time` /
    # `end_time` / `paused` each have a legal absent rendering — a degraded field plus a
    # non-fatal advisory is a schema-legal document, and failing the WHOLE listing over
    # one legacy cell in one package is not.
    #
    # Stated as a RULE, not a roster: the four rows below are today's blob-sourced
    # values, and the criterion is met only if it also holds for a fifth added later.
    # `targeting_overlay` is the fifth row on purpose — it is the one blob value already
    # resolved before the constructor, so it grades the code/recovery half of the same
    # contract rather than the whole-listing half.
    #
    # CODE AND RECOVERY, NOT MERELY "AN ADVISORY EXISTS". A corrupt cell in the SELLER's
    # own store is not buyer-remediable, so VALIDATION_ERROR / recovery "correctable"
    # ("review error details and fix field values") is the wrong answer — it is the exact
    # defect recorded under the revision outline below, where the response-model boundary
    # translated a seller-side defect into buyer-directed advice. Pinned
    # enums/error-code.json gives CONFIGURATION_ERROR recovery "terminal", and
    # core/error.json makes the wire `recovery` authoritative with enumMetadata only its
    # documentary mirror — so the grader reads `recovery` off the wire.

    # GetMediaBuysMediaBuy outside every handler.
    #
    # This row exists because the fix was UNGRADED: reverting it to the raw read left
    # the whole tree green, so nothing would have caught its removal. `buyer_campaign_ref`

    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_media_buys request for media_buy_ids ["mb-001"]

    And the media buy "mb-001" confirmed_at should be null on the wire
    # HAND-EDITED (#1900): authored locally, not rendered from adcp-req. The marker is
    # load-bearing — compile_bdd's merge classifies a LEGACY-only scenario without one
    # as LEGACY-DELETE, and an Examples row added to an UPSTREAM scenario is replaced
    # wholesale by the EXAMPLES-ONLY bucket. So this obligation can only be graded
    # locally as its own marked scenario.
    #
    # Why it exists: confirmed_at is required-and-nullable on the pinned item schema,
    # and the library base serializes with exclude_none=True. Every other confirmed_at
    # scenario seeds a NON-null value, so the key survives there on its own merit and
    # the retention path is never exercised. These buys reach the buyer with the column
    # still NULL, which is exactly where a dropped key produces an item that fails
    # item-level validation.
    #
    # The seeds are the statuses OUTSIDE _SELLER_COMMITTED_STATUSES (models.py) that
    # get_media_buys publishes: rejected is INV-7's terminal pass-through, draft and
    # pending_approval are INV-8's pre-serving states. canceled is deliberately NOT
    # here — it IS a committed status, so its confirmed_at is legitimately stamped, and
    # seeding it would assert a premise production correctly refuses.
