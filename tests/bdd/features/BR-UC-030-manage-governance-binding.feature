Feature: BR-UC-030 Manage Governance Binding
  As a Buyer
  I want to bind a single governance agent per account so that the Seller Agent can validate my planned media buys outbound during the campaign lifecycle
  So that governance approvals (purchase, modification, delivery) are routed through the agent I designate and lifecycle continuity is preserved via a signed governance_context

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows the seller persisted the governance agent binding per account
  #   POST-S2: Buyer receives the echoed governance agent URL per account (credentials NOT echoed)
  #   POST-S3: Idempotent replay of sync_governance returns the prior result
  #   POST-S4: adcp_version echoed on every response
  #   POST-S5: Subsequent media-buy lifecycle events route through the bound governance agent
  #   POST-S6: Seller obtains a governance decision (approved/conditions/denied) OR a transport/operation-level governance failure (not a status value)
  #   POST-S7: Seller persists and forwards governance_context (JWS) unchanged
  #   POST-S8: Seller knows expires_at on approved/conditions decisions
  #   POST-S9: On conditions, seller applies adjustments and re-checks
  #   POST-S10: On denied, seller surfaces findings and does not proceed
  #   POST-S11: next_check schedules ongoing delivery reporting
  #   POST-F1: System state unchanged on operation-level failure
  #   POST-F2: Buyer/seller knows what failed and the specific error code
  #   POST-F3: Application context echoed when possible
  #
  # Extensions: A (GOVERNANCE_DENIED), B (SYNC_PARTIAL_FAILURE)
  # Error codes: AUTH_REQUIRED, ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND, SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT,
  #   PERMISSION_DENIED, GOVERNANCE_DENIED (semantic), GOVERNANCE_UNAVAILABLE,
  #   URL_NOT_HTTPS, CREDENTIALS_TOO_SHORT, GOVERNANCE_AGENTS_CARDINALITY,
  #   IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REQUIRED, IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_INVALID, IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT,
  #   INVALID_REQUEST
  #
  # v3.1 BR-formalization coverage (BR-RULE-241..255): idempotency conflict,
  #   per-account PERMISSION_DENIED, check addressing (plan_id/caller),
  #   shape inference (budget-availability probe), governance-failure fail-closed
  #   (GOVERNANCE_UNAVAILABLE), JWS verification failure (PERMISSION_DENIED),
  #   opaque findings taxonomy, per-account replace scope.

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant is resolvable from the request context

  Scenario Outline: Sync governance binding via <transport> (single account, fresh binding)
    Given the Buyer Agent has an authenticated connection
    And the agent has authority over account "acct-social-001"
    And no governance agent is currently bound to "acct-social-001"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a sync_governance request via <transport> with idempotency_key "uuid-v4-fresh-0000000000000001" and one account "acct-social-001" bound to governance agent "https://governance.pinnacle-media.com" with Bearer credentials of length 64
    Then the response variant is success and carries an accounts array with 1 item
    And the account "acct-social-001" has status "synced"
    And the response account "acct-social-001" echoes governance_agents[0].url "https://governance.pinnacle-media.com"
    And the response account "acct-social-001" does NOT echo governance_agents[0].authentication
    And the response carries an echoed adcp_version envelope

  @T-UC-030-sync-replace @sync @replace-semantics @post-s1
  Scenario: Sync governance replaces a previously bound agent on the same account
    Given the Buyer Agent has an authenticated connection
    And the agent has authority over account "acct-social-001"
    And account "acct-social-001" is currently bound to governance agent "https://governance.old-buyer.com"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a sync_governance request via MCP with idempotency_key "uuid-v4-replace-000000000000002" and one account "acct-social-001" bound to governance agent "https://governance.new-buyer.com" with Bearer credentials of length 64
    Then the account "acct-social-001" has status "synced"
    And the persisted governance agent on "acct-social-001" is "https://governance.new-buyer.com"
    And the previous binding to "https://governance.old-buyer.com" is no longer present

    When the Buyer Agent sends the same sync_governance request with idempotency_key "uuid-v4-replay-0000000000000003" again
    Then the response matches the prior sync result for "acct-social-001"

  Scenario: Governance agent returns status=denied with findings (Extension A)
    Given account "acct-social-001" is bound to governance agent "https://governance.pinnacle-media.com"
    When the Seller Agent calls check_governance outbound with plan_id "plan-2026-q2-001", caller "https://seller.example.com", phase "purchase", tool "create_media_buy", and a payload that violates the governance plan
    Then the governance agent returns status "denied" with findings (minItems 1), explanation, and a governance_context JWS
    And each finding carries category_id, severity, and explanation
    And the Seller Agent persists the governance_context for audit
    And the Seller Agent does NOT proceed with create_media_buy
    And the Seller Agent surfaces the denial to the buyer with the findings attached
    And the surfaced denial error should include a "suggestion" field guiding buyer remediation

    And the Seller Agent obtained governance_context JWS "JWS-token-aaaa.bbbb.cccc" from a prior check on plan "plan-2026-q2-001"
    When the Seller Agent calls check_governance outbound again on the same plan with phase "modification" and a modification_summary
    Then the request carries governance_context exactly "JWS-token-aaaa.bbbb.cccc" with no modification

    When the Seller Agent attempts to proceed with the governed action after expires_at

    When the Seller Agent calls check_governance outbound with plan_id "plan-2026-q2-001", caller "https://seller.example.com", phase "purchase", tool "create_media_buy", and a payload representing the proposed media buy
    Then the Seller Agent obtains no governance decision
    And the Seller Agent treats the outcome as non-approval and does NOT proceed with the governed action

    And the Seller Agent is a 3.1 seller that verifies the governance_context JWS per the AdCP JWS profile
    When the Seller Agent receives a governance_context that fails verification because <reason>
    Then the Seller Agent MUST NOT treat the governed request as governance-approved

    And the Seller Agent received a check_governance decision carrying findings with agent-internal category_id and policy_id values
    When the Seller Agent surfaces a finding to the buyer
    Then the Seller Agent MUST NOT pattern-match category_id or policy_id against a fixed list

  @T-UC-030-storyboard-binding-used-during-create-media-buy @schema-v3.1 @v3-1 @binding @create-media-buy-integration
  Scenario: Governance agent bound via sync_governance is invoked by the seller during create_media_buy
    Given the buyer has registered governance agent "https://governance.pinnacle-agency.example" on the account via sync_governance
    When the Buyer Agent subsequently sends create_media_buy under the same account
    Then the Seller Agent should call check_governance against the previously registered governance agent URL
    And the seller MUST NOT skip the governance check when an agent is bound to the account
    And the seller MUST NOT call a governance agent URL other than the one registered via sync_governance for this account
    # governance/index.yaml and media-buy/index.yaml governance_setup phases:
    # the storyboard contract is two-step: (1) sync_governance stores the
    # governance agent URL on the account, and (2) the seller invokes that
    # agent during create_media_buy validation. UC-030 covers both halves
    # individually; this storyboard scenario anchors the integration -- the
    # specific governance URL persisted at sync time MUST be the URL the
    # seller calls at create_media_buy time.
    # governance binding integration: sync_governance URL is the only URL invoked at create_media_buy time
