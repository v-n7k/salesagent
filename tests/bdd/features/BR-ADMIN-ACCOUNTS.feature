# Hand-authored feature — not compiled from adcp-req
# Admin UI BDD scenarios for account management (salesagent-oj0.1.1)

Feature: BR-ADMIN-ACCOUNTS Admin Account Management
  As a Tenant Admin
  I want to manage accounts through the admin web interface
  So that I can list, create, edit, and control account status for my tenant

  # This feature covers the admin UI account management blueprint.
  # Unlike BR-UC-011 (API-level account management for buyer agents),
  # this feature tests human admin interactions through HTML forms.
  #
  # Transports:
  #   - integration: Flask test_client (in-process, no Docker)
  #   - e2e: requests.Session against Docker stack (full deployment)

  Background:
    Given an admin user is authenticated for tenant "test-tenant"
    And the tenant "test-tenant" exists in the database

  @T-ADMIN-ACCT-001 @list @main-flow
  Scenario: List accounts for tenant
    Given the tenant has the following accounts:
      | name       | status    | brand_domain  |
      | Acme Corp  | active    | acme-corp.com |
      | Beta Inc   | suspended | beta.com      |
    When the admin navigates to the accounts list page
    Then the page returns status 200
    And the page contains "Accounts"
    And the page shows 2 accounts
    And the page shows account "Acme Corp" with status "active"
    And the page shows account "Beta Inc" with status "suspended"

  @T-ADMIN-ACCT-002 @create @main-flow
  Scenario: Create a new account
    When the admin navigates to the create account page
    Then the page returns status 200
    And the page contains "Create New Account"
    When the admin submits the create account form with:
      | field         | value         |
      | name          | New Corp      |
      | brand_domain  | new-corp.com  |
      | operator      | example-media |
      | billing       | operator      |
      | payment_terms | net_30        |
    Then the admin is redirected to the accounts list
    And the database contains an account named "New Corp"
    And the account "New Corp" has brand domain "new-corp.com"

  @T-ADMIN-ACCT-003 @detail @main-flow
  Scenario: View account detail page
    Given the tenant has an account "Acme Corp" with status "active"
    When the admin navigates to the account detail page for "Acme Corp"
    Then the page returns status 200
    And the page contains "Acme Corp"
    And the page shows the account status as "active"
    And the page shows action buttons for "Suspended" and "Closed"
    And the page does not show action button for "Active"

  @T-ADMIN-ACCT-004 @edit @main-flow
  Scenario: Edit account mutable fields
    Given the tenant has an account "Acme Corp" with status "active"
    When the admin navigates to the edit page for "Acme Corp"
    Then the page returns status 200
    And the page contains "Edit Account"
    When the admin submits the edit form with:
      | field         | value             |
      | name          | Acme Corp Updated |
      | billing       | agent             |
      | payment_terms | net_60            |
    Then the admin is redirected to the account detail page
    And the database shows account "Acme Corp Updated" with billing "agent"

  @T-ADMIN-ACCT-011 @edit @natural-key @edge-case
  Scenario: The edit form does not offer to change a natural-key component
    Given the tenant has an account "Acme Corp" with status "active"
    When the admin navigates to the edit page for "Acme Corp"
    Then the page returns status 200
    And the "sandbox" control is not editable
    And the "operator" control is not editable
    # sandbox and operator are natural-key components (AccountRepository.get_by_natural_key).
    # Editing either RE-KEYS the account, so the buyer's next sync_accounts call carrying the
    # original key stops matching and provisions a DUPLICATE, stranding the account_id they
    # hold (salesagent-8sfr). The repository refuses both outright; this scenario grades the
    # AFFORDANCE -- that an operator is not invited to attempt it and then silently ignored.
    # Enforcement (not affordance) is graded by
    # tests/integration/test_account_natural_key_immutability.py.

  @T-ADMIN-ACCT-012 @create @natural-key @edge-case
  Scenario: Creating a second account on an occupied natural key is refused
    Given the tenant has an account "Acme Corp" with brand domain "acme.com" and operator "example.com"
    When the admin submits the create account form with:
      | field        | value       |
      | name         | Acme Copy   |
      | brand_domain | acme.com    |
      | operator     | example.com |
      | billing      | operator    |
    Then the admin is redirected back to the create page
    And exactly 1 account matches brand domain "acme.com" and operator "example.com"
    And the account matching brand domain "acme.com" and operator "example.com" is named "Acme Corp"
    # The create-side sibling of T-ADMIN-ACCT-011. That one keeps the key from being MUTATED;
    # this keeps a second account from being CREATED on a key that already resolves. Both end
    # the same way for the buyer: get_by_natural_key().first() starts answering
    # non-deterministically and list_by_natural_key reports the key unresolvable, and they
    # cannot repair it -- they do not own the row the operator added (salesagent-0njj).
    # The database-level invariant behind this refusal, and the NULL mechanics that make it
    # cover sandbox and brand_id, are graded by
    # tests/integration/test_account_natural_key_uniqueness.py.

  @T-ADMIN-ACCT-013 @create @natural-key
  Scenario: A different operator is a different natural key and is still creatable
    Given the tenant has an account "Acme Corp" with brand domain "acme.com" and operator "example.com"
    When the admin submits the create account form with:
      | field        | value        |
      | name         | Acme Reseller |
      | brand_domain | acme.com     |
      | operator     | reseller.com |
      | billing      | operator     |
    Then the admin is redirected to the accounts list
    And exactly 1 account matches brand domain "acme.com" and operator "reseller.com"
    # The refusal is scoped to a COLLIDING key. Without this, refusing every create would
    # satisfy T-ADMIN-ACCT-012 while breaking the create form outright -- and one brand
    # legitimately holds separate accounts per operator.

  @T-ADMIN-ACCT-005 @status @main-flow
  Scenario: Change account status via AJAX API
    Given the tenant has an account "Acme Corp" with status "active"
    When the admin sends a status change request for "Acme Corp" to "suspended"
    Then the JSON response has "success" as true
    And the JSON response has "status" as "suspended"
    And the database shows account "Acme Corp" with status "suspended"

  @T-ADMIN-ACCT-006 @status @validation @edge-case
  Scenario: Reject invalid status transition
    Given the tenant has an account "Acme Corp" with status "active"
    When the admin sends a status change request for "Acme Corp" to "rejected"
    Then the page returns status 400
    And the JSON response has "success" as false
    And the JSON response has "error" containing "Cannot transition"
    And the database shows account "Acme Corp" with status "active"

    Given the tenant has the following accounts:
      | name       | status           | brand_domain |
      | Active Co  | active           | active.com   |
      | Pending Co | pending_approval | pending.com  |
      | Closed Co  | closed           | closed.com   |
    When the admin navigates to the accounts list page with status filter "active"
    Then the page returns status 200
    And the page shows 1 accounts
    And the page shows account "Active Co" with status "active"
    And the page does not show account "Pending Co"

  @T-ADMIN-ACCT-008 @validation @create @edge-case
  Scenario: Reject account creation with missing name
    When the admin submits the create account form with:
      | field        | value       |
      | name         |             |
      | brand_domain | unnamed.com |
    Then the admin is redirected back to the create page
    And the database does not contain an account with brand domain "unnamed.com"

  @T-ADMIN-ACCT-009 @auth @edge-case
