# Hand-authored feature — manual overrides for auto-generated UC-002 scenarios.
#
# Some auto-generated scenarios are missing Given steps that are needed for
# the Then assertions to work (e.g., webhook config). These manual overrides
# add the missing setup while preserving the original scenario intent.
#
# The original scenarios are xfailed in conftest.py in favor of these.

Feature: BR-UC-002 Manual Overrides
  Corrected scenarios from BR-UC-002-create-media-buy.feature with
  missing Given steps added.

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant exists with completed setup checklist
    And the Buyer is authenticated

  # Replaces T-UC-002-alt-manual-reject from auto-generated feature.
  # Original scenario has no Given step for push_notification_config,
  # but Then asserts "Buyer should be notified via webhook" which
  # requires a webhook URL to verify against.

  Scenario: Seller rejects a pending media buy (with webhook)
    Given the buyer has configured a webhook for notifications
    And a media buy exists in "pending_approval" state
    When the Seller rejects the media buy with reason "Budget too low for Q1 campaign"
    Then the media buy status should be "rejected"
    And the response should include "rejection_reason" containing "Budget too low"
    And the Buyer should be notified via webhook
