Feature: BR-UC-032 Compliance Test Controller (Sandbox-Only)
  As a conformance Runner driving compliance tests against a seller's sandbox
  I want to invoke comply_test_controller scenarios to force state transitions, simulate delivery, seed fixtures, and inspect upstream traffic
  So that I can validate the seller's behavior deterministically without orchestrating long happy-path setups — AND verify the seller refuses production-account invocations

  # SANDBOX-ONLY: per schema description, "Sellers MUST NOT expose this tool in production."
  # The defining business rule is the sandbox-only gate enforced by Extension A (FORBIDDEN).

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Sandbox-only gate passed — targeted account is sandbox-flagged in persisted records
  #   POST-S2: list_scenarios returns seller's advertised scenario set
  #   POST-S3: force_* state scenarios transition entity; response carries previous_state and current_state
  #   POST-S4: force_create_media_buy_arm registers single-shot directive
  #   POST-S5: force_task_completion marks task complete with verbatim result delivery
  #   POST-S6: simulate_* applies simulated values; cumulative carries running totals (simulate_delivery)
  #   POST-S7: seed_* pre-populates fixture with stable ID
  #   POST-S8: query_upstream_traffic returns per-principal-scoped recorded_calls with secrets redacted
  #   POST-S9: Request context echoed unchanged
  #   POST-S10: Naturally idempotent — replays converge to same observable state
  #   POST-F1: System state unchanged on failure
  #   POST-F2: Runner receives structured error (success: false, error enum)
  #   POST-F3: Context echoed on failure when possible
  #   POST-F4: Production exposure rejected — targeting non-sandbox account returns FORBIDDEN
  #
  # Rules: BR-1 (SANDBOX-ONLY gate), BR-2 (caller declaration const: true), BR-3 (seller persisted-record verification),
  #        BR-4 (per-scenario if/then params), BR-5 (idempotent), BR-6 (open-for-extension),
  #        BR-7 (per-principal scoping), BR-8 (secret redaction), BR-9 (synthetic-vectors-only),
  #        BR-10 (force_task_completion verbatim delivery), BR-11 (force_create_media_buy_arm single-shot),
  #        BR-12 (structured error envelope), BR-13 (context echo)
  # Extensions: A (FORBIDDEN — production exposure rejected), B (scenario-level errors)
  # Error codes: FORBIDDEN, INVALID_TRANSITION, INVALID_STATE, NOT_FOUND, UNKNOWN_SCENARIO, INVALID_PARAMS, INTERNAL_ERROR

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the Runner has an authenticated connection to the Seller Agent

      | Caller P with NO outbound calls in window → UpstreamTrafficSuccess with recorded_calls: [] |
      | P1 and P2 both query against shared sandbox account → disjoint views |
