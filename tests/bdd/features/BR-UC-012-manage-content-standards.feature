Feature: BR-UC-012 Manage Content Standards
  As a Buyer
  I want to define, discover, and maintain brand safety and suitability policies
  So that I can control what publisher content is acceptable adjacent to my advertising

  #   POST-S3: Buyer can discover all content standards matching scope filters
  #   POST-S4: Buyer has updated an existing content standard (new version created)
  #   POST-S5: Buyer has deleted an obsolete content standard not in use
  #   POST-S6: Application context echoed unchanged in response

  Scenario Outline: List content standards via <transport> - returns matching standards
    Given the tenant has 3 content standards with different scopes
    And the Buyer Agent has an authenticated connection via <transport>
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_content_standards request
    Then the response contains a standards array with 3 items
    And each standard includes standards_id, scope, and policies
    And the request context is echoed in the response
    # POST-S3: Buyer discovers all content standards matching scope filters
