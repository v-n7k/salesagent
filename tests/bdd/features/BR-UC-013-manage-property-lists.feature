Feature: BR-UC-013 Manage Property Lists
  As a Buyer
  I want to create, discover, retrieve, update, and delete curated property lists
  So that I can reference them in targeting requests to filter inventory by publisher properties

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer has created a new property list and received list_id and auth_token
  #   POST-S2: Buyer can retrieve full property list configuration and optionally resolved identifiers by ID
  #   POST-S3: Buyer can discover all property lists matching optional filters (owning account, name substring)
  #   POST-S4: Buyer has updated an existing property list (full replacement semantics)
  #   POST-S5: Buyer has deleted a property list that was not in active use
  #   POST-S6: Application context from the request is echoed unchanged in the response
  #   POST-S7: Auth token is returned only at creation time (one-shot secret)
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on failure
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what failed and the specific error code
  #   POST-F3: Application context is still echoed when possible
  #   POST-F4: When a list is not found, the error references the provided list_id
  #
  # Rules: BR-RULE-070..078, BR-RULE-043, BR-RULE-257/258/259 (13 rules)

  Scenario Outline: List property lists via <transport> -- returns all tenant lists
    Given the tenant has 3 property lists with different names
    And the Buyer Agent has an authenticated connection via <transport>
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_property_lists request
    Then the response contains a lists array with 3 items
    And each list includes list_id, name, and metadata
    And the request context is echoed in the response
    # POST-S3: Buyer discovers all property lists matching optional filters

  @T-UC-013-002 @list @no-filter @post-s3 @partition @boundary @br-rule-078
  Scenario: List property lists -- no filters returns all tenant lists
    Given the tenant has 5 property lists
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_property_lists request with no filters
    Then the response contains a lists array with 5 items
    # BR-RULE-078 INV-1: No filter parameters -> all property lists for tenant returned
    # @bva boundary: name_contains filter with empty string (equivalent to no filter)

  @T-UC-013-003 @list @filter @post-s3 @partition @br-rule-078 @schema-v3.1
  Scenario: List property lists -- account filter returns only owned lists

    And the tenant has a property list owned by account {"account_id": "acc-beta"}
    When the Buyer Agent filters by account {"account_id": "acc-alpha"}
    Then the response contains 1 property list
    And the list is owned by account {"account_id": "acc-alpha"}

    Given the tenant has a property list named "Q4 Travel Inclusion"
    And the tenant has a property list named "TRAVEL Exclusion List"
    And the tenant has a property list named "Sports Campaign"
    When the Buyer Agent filters by name_contains "travel"

  @T-UC-013-webhook-signature-verify @schema-v3.1 @webhook @signature @property-list-changed
  Scenario: Property list changed webhook -- payload with unverifiable signature is rejected
    Given the recipient holds the sender's published public key
    When a property_list_changed webhook arrives whose signature does not verify against that key
    Then the recipient rejects the payload and does not act on it
    And the recipient does not call get_property_list for that payload
    # BR-RULE-259 INV-4: recipient MUST verify signature against sender public key; reject if unverifiable

  Scenario Outline: Property list changed webhook -- emission gated by <webhook_state>
    Given a property list whose <webhook_state>
    When the resolved property set changes
    Then a property_list_changed webhook is <emission>
    # BR-RULE-259 INV-5: emitted only when webhook_url configured; empty string removes subscription

    Examples:
      | webhook_state                                   | emission    |
      | webhook_url is configured                       | emitted     |
      | webhook_url was cleared by setting empty string | not emitted |
      | webhook_url was never configured                | not emitted |
