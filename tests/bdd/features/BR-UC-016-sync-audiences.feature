Feature: BR-UC-016 Sync Audiences
  As a Buyer
  I want to manage first-party CRM audiences on a seller account
  So that I can upload, update, discover, and delete audience segments for targeting campaigns

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer has synced audiences and received per-audience action results
  #   POST-S2: Buyer can discover all audiences on an account without modification
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows the matching status and seller_id for each audience
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows uploaded and matched member counts
  #   POST-S5: Buyer has deleted a specific audience and received confirmation
  #   POST-S6: Buyer has purged buyer-managed audiences not in the request
  #   POST-S7: Application context from the request is echoed unchanged
  #   POST-S8: When remove and add contain the same identifier, remove takes precedence
  #   POST-S9: Async/governance-gated uploads surface a SyncAudiencesSubmitted envelope (status=submitted + task_id)
  #   POST-S10: Buyer can read a per-identifier-type match_breakdown for each audience whose seller reports per-type matching
  #   POST-S11: Replaying a sync with a previously-seen idempotency_key returns the original result (at-most-once)
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on complete operation failure
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what failed and the specific error code with recovery
  #   POST-F3: Application context is still echoed when possible
  #   POST-F4: Individual audience failures do not prevent other audiences from being processed
  #
  # Rules: BR-RULE-113..132, 209, 211 (idempotency), 230 (match_breakdown/effective_match_rate), 231 (CONFLICT)
  # Extensions: A (sync/upsert), B (delete specific), C (bulk delete missing),
  #   D (ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND), E (INVALID_REQUEST), F (AUDIENCE_TOO_SMALL),
  #   G (UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE), H (AUTH_REQUIRED), I (RATE_LIMITED), J (SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE),

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the Buyer is authenticated with a valid principal_id
    And the seller has declared audience_targeting capability as true
    And the account reference resolves to a valid account


  @T-UC-016-main @main-flow @discovery @post-s2 @post-s7
  Scenario Outline: Discovery-only mode via <transport> -- list all audiences on account
    Given the account has 3 synced audiences with various statuses
    And the Buyer Agent has an authenticated connection via <transport>
    When the Buyer Agent sends a sync_audiences request via <transport> with no audiences array
    Then the response is a SyncAudiencesSuccess with an audiences array
    And the response contains 3 audience results
    And each audience result has action "unchanged"
    And each audience result has uploaded_count 0
    And the request context is echoed in the response
    # POST-S2: Buyer discovers all audiences without modification
    # POST-S7: Application context echoed unchanged

    Examples:
      | transport |
      | MCP       |
      | REST      |

  @T-UC-016-discovery-empty @main-flow @discovery @post-s2 @boundary
  Scenario: Discovery-only mode -- empty account returns empty audiences array
    Given the account has 0 audiences
    When the Buyer Agent sends a sync_audiences request with no audiences array
    Then the response is a SyncAudiencesSuccess with an audiences array
    And the audiences array is empty
    # BR-RULE-125 INV-4: no audiences exist -> empty array returned

    When the Buyer Agent sends a sync_audiences request with audiences
    Then the response is a SyncAudiencesSubmitted envelope
    And the response has status "submitted"
    And the response has a task_id

    Then the response is a SyncAudiencesSubmitted envelope
    And the response has status "submitted"

  Scenario: Submitted envelope message field is untrusted seller input -- buyer must sanitize
    Given the seller returns a SyncAudiencesSubmitted envelope with a hostile message field
    When the Buyer Agent renders or forwards the response
    Then the message field is treated as untrusted seller input
    And the buyer escapes the message before rendering to any HTML UI
    And the buyer sanitizes or isolates the message before passing to an LLM prompt context

    Given the Buyer Agent submits a sync_audiences request with a CRM list whose matched count falls below the seller's minimum
    When the Seller Agent returns a SyncAudiencesSuccess with that audience's status set to "too_small"
    Then the per-audience error.details object conforms to /schemas/error-details/audience-too-small.json

    And error.details.resource_id equals "aud_loyalty_2026"

    When the Seller Agent processes the request
    Then the response is a SyncAudiencesSuccess

  Scenario Outline: idempotency_key format rejection boundary -- <boundary>
    Given a sync_audiences request whose idempotency_key is "<key_condition>"
    When the Buyer Agent sends the sync_audiences request
    Then the request is rejected with error code "INVALID_REQUEST"
    And the error code should be "INVALID_REQUEST"
    And the error should include a "suggestion" field for how to fix the idempotency_key
