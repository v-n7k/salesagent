# Hand-authored feature — not compiled from adcp-req.
#
# LOCALLY-ADDED (survives BR-*.feature regeneration).
#
# Upstream gap: the BR-UC-010 storyboard grades what a CONFORMANT seller emits, but
# has no scenario for an operator declaring a capability this deployment does not
# back. Under the STRICT policy (owner, 2026-07-27) that rejection is the whole point
# of the declaration store — a tenant must not be able to make the wire promise
# behavior production lacks — so the backing rules would otherwise ship ungraded.
#
# The generated `T-UC-010-v31-specialisms` scenario cannot grade them: it declares
# `creative-generative` AND requires the `creative` protocol, both unbacked, so it
# stays xfailed against #1724 rather than being weakened to pass.
#
# Reconcile upstream in adcp-req (a "seller rejects an unbacked capability
# declaration" scenario), then retire this file in favor of the regenerated one.

Feature: UC-010 get_adcp_capabilities — capability declarations must be implementation-backed (local)

  @T-UC-010-local-backed-specialism @v31 @invariant
  Scenario: a backed specialism and its parent protocol are echoed alongside the defaults
    Given a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the tenant declares specialisms ["signal-owned"] with supported_protocols ["signals"]
    When the Buyer Agent calls get_adcp_capabilities
    Then the response is compliant with the get_adcp_capabilities spec
    And specialisms should equal ["sales-non-guaranteed", "signal-owned"]
    And supported_protocols should equal ["media_buy", "signals"]
    # UNION, never replacement: the declaration adds to the baseline rather than
    # replacing it. Replacing would drop media_buy and orphan the unconditionally
    # emitted `sales-non-guaranteed`, whose parent protocol is media-buy — the
    # self-inconsistent wire /properties/specialisms says the runner rejects.
    # signal-owned is backed: its bundle requires only get_signals, which this
    # deployment implements, and it requires zero storyboard scenarios.

  @T-UC-010-local-unbacked-specialism @v31 @invariant @error-path
  Scenario: declaring a specialism this deployment does not implement is rejected when capabilities are requested
    Given a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the tenant declares specialisms ["creative-generative"] with supported_protocols ["media_buy"]
    When the Buyer Agent calls get_adcp_capabilities
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the capability declaration should be rejected as terminal misconfiguration
    And the rejection should name capability "specialisms" and rejected value "creative-generative"
    # Nothing implements generative creative, and the AAO compliance runner grades
    # the claim, so echoing the declaration would be a false conformance claim.
    # Tracked by #1724.
    # The operator must be told WHICH claim was refused: a bare CONFIGURATION_ERROR
    # makes them bisect their own config.

  @T-UC-010-local-orphaned-specialism @v31 @invariant @error-path @boundary
  Scenario: a backed specialism without its parent protocol is rejected
    Given a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the tenant declares specialisms ["signal-owned"] without declaring its parent protocol
    When the Buyer Agent calls get_adcp_capabilities
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the capability declaration should be rejected as terminal misconfiguration
    And the rejection should name capability "specialisms" and rejected value "signal-owned (needs signals)"
    # Roll-up coherence: /properties/specialisms — "the runner rejects a specialism
    # claim whose parent protocol is missing". Boundary case for the backing rule:
    # the specialism IS backed, so only the roll-up check can catch this.

  @T-UC-010-local-unbacked-protocol @v31 @invariant @error-path
  Scenario: declaring a protocol this deployment does not serve is rejected when capabilities are requested
    Given a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the tenant declares supported_protocols ["creative"]
    When the Buyer Agent calls get_adcp_capabilities
    Then the error is compliant with the AdCP error spec
    And the capability declaration should be rejected as terminal misconfiguration
    And the rejection should name capability "supported_protocols" and rejected value "creative"
    # A protocol claim commits the seller to that domain's required tool surface
    # (protocols/<p>/index.yaml#required_tools). Generative creative is unimplemented
    # here, so advertising `creative` would route buyer traffic to a domain that
    # cannot answer. Tracked by #1724.
