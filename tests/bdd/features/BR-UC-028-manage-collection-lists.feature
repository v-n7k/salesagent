Feature: BR-UC-028 Manage Collection Lists
  As a Buyer
  I want to create, discover, retrieve, update, and delete curated collection lists
  So that I can reference them in targeting requests to filter inventory by content (shows, films, podcasts, genres)

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer has created a new collection list and received list_id and auth_token
  #   POST-S2: Buyer can retrieve full collection list configuration and optionally resolved collections by ID
  #   POST-S3: Buyer can discover all collection lists matching optional filters (account, name substring)
  #   POST-S4: Buyer has updated an existing collection list (full replacement semantics)
  #   POST-S5: Buyer has deleted a collection list that was not in active use
  #   POST-S6: Application context from the request is echoed unchanged in the response
  #   POST-S7: Auth token is returned only at creation time (one-shot secret)
  #   POST-S8: Subscribers receive collection_list_changed webhook on resolved-list changes
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on failure
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what failed and the specific error code
  #   POST-F3: Application context is still echoed when possible
  #   POST-F4: When a list is not found, the error references the provided list_id
  #
  # Extensions: A (create), B (get), C (update), D (delete), E (not found), F (access denied), G (in use), H (webhook)
  # Error codes (v3.1 authoritative vocabulary): REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND, LIST_ACCESS_DENIED, LIST_IN_USE,
