Feature: BR-UC-024 Content Compliance
  As a Buyer or Seller
  I want to calibrate content evaluation models, retrieve media buy artifacts, and validate content delivery against brand safety standards
  So that advertising delivery contexts meet agreed brand safety and suitability standards throughout the campaign lifecycle

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Seller has received a calibration verdict (pass/fail) with detailed explanation for a submitted artifact
  #   POST-S2: Buyer has received content artifacts from a media buy, collected according to the media buy's configured sampling rate and method (set at buy creation, not per request)
  #   POST-S3: Buyer has received per-record validation verdicts (pass/fail) with optional feature breakdowns
  #   POST-S4: Buyer can detect drift between Seller's local verdicts and Verification Agent's independent assessment
  #   POST-S5: Application context from the request is echoed unchanged in the response
  #   POST-S6: Artifact collection metadata (collection_info) is reported alongside artifact results
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on failure
  #   POST-F2: Buyer or Seller knows what failed and the specific error code
  #   POST-F3: Application context is still echoed when possible

  @T-UC-024-artifact-webhook-dedup-by-key @v3-1 @artifact-webhook @idempotency
  Scenario: Recipient deduplicates artifact webhook deliveries by idempotency_key
    Given an orchestrator has registered an artifacts webhook endpoint
    And the sales agent pushes an artifact batch with idempotency_key "ak_4mP_5d9Q-3xC.7vNb"
    When the sales agent retries the same emission with the same idempotency_key
    Then the orchestrator should record only one logical delivery for that idempotency_key
    And idempotency_key dedup should be scoped to the authenticated sender identity
    # POST-S5: at-least-once delivery does not cause double processing
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/content-standards/get-media-buy-artifacts-request.json

  @T-UC-024-artifact-webhook-rebatch-new-key @v3-1 @artifact-webhook @idempotency
  Scenario: Corrected re-emission of the same batch_id carries a fresh idempotency_key
    Given the sales agent previously pushed batch_id "batch-2026-05-21-001" with idempotency_key "ak_first_emission_001"
    When the sales agent re-emits a corrected version of the same batch_id
    Then the new payload should carry a different idempotency_key from "ak_first_emission_001"
    And the new payload should still carry batch_id "batch-2026-05-21-001"
    # idempotency_key identifies the emission event, not the logical batch

  @T-UC-024-inv-260-missing-key @v3-1 @invariant @BR-RULE-260 @error @idempotency
  Scenario: BR-RULE-260 INV-1 violated -- calibrate_content missing required idempotency_key rejected
    Given a content standard "std-260" exists
    And a calibrate_content request with a valid artifact but no idempotency_key
    When the Seller invokes calibrate_content with standards_id "std-260"
    Then the operation should fail
    And the error code should be "INVALID_REQUEST"
    And the error should include "suggestion" field
    # POST-F2: missing required field identified
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/content-standards/get-media-buy-artifacts-request.json

  @T-UC-024-inv-260-replay @v3-1 @invariant @BR-RULE-260 @idempotency
  Scenario: BR-RULE-260 INV-2 holds -- replayed calibrate_content key returns cached response without re-running work
    Given a content standard "std-261" exists
    And the Seller has already processed a calibrate_content request with idempotency_key "ck_replay_0001_abcd" for the authenticated sender
    When the Seller receives the same calibrate_content request with idempotency_key "ck_replay_0001_abcd" and the same payload
    Then the original cached calibration response is returned
    And no duplicate calibration evaluation work is performed
    And idempotency_key dedup is scoped to the authenticated sender identity
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/content-standards/get-media-buy-artifacts-request.json

  @T-UC-024-inv-260-cross-sender @v3-1 @invariant @BR-RULE-260 @idempotency
  Scenario: BR-RULE-260 INV-2 -- identical idempotency_key from different senders does not collide
    Given sender A has processed a calibrate_content request with idempotency_key "ck_shared_key_00001"
    When sender B submits a calibrate_content request with the same idempotency_key "ck_shared_key_00001"
    Then sender B's request is processed independently and not deduped against sender A
    And idempotency_key dedup remains scoped to each authenticated sender identity

  @T-UC-024-boundary-idempotency-key @v3-1 @boundary @BR-RULE-260 @idempotency
  Scenario Outline: BR-RULE-260 INV-3 -- calibrate_content idempotency_key boundary validation - <boundary_point>
    Given a content standard "std-263" exists
    And a calibrate_content request with idempotency_key at the boundary: <boundary_point>
    When the Seller invokes calibrate_content with standards_id "std-263"
    Then <outcome>
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/content-standards/get-media-buy-artifacts-request.json

    Examples: Boundary values
      | boundary_point                          | outcome                                          |
      | 16-char key (minimum)                   | the operation succeeds                           |
      | 255-char key (maximum)                  | the operation succeeds                           |
      | 15-char key (below minimum)             | error "INVALID_REQUEST" with suggestion         |
      | 256-char key (above maximum)            | error "VALIDATION_ERROR" with suggestion         |
      | key with space (pattern violation)      | error "INVALID_REQUEST" with suggestion         |

  @T-UC-024-inv-260-conflict @v3-1 @invariant @BR-RULE-260 @error @idempotency
  Scenario: BR-RULE-260 INV-4 violated -- corrected re-emission reusing prior key with changed payload conflicts
    Given a calibrate_content emission with idempotency_key "ck_conflict_0001_wxyz" was already processed
    When a corrected re-emission reuses idempotency_key "ck_conflict_0001_wxyz" with a changed payload
    Then the operation should fail
    And the error code should be "IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT"
    And the error should include "suggestion" field
    # POST-F2: corrected re-emission must mint a fresh key
    # @source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1 commit=467fd93d7 path=static/schemas/source/content-standards/get-media-buy-artifacts-request.json

  @T-UC-024-inv-260-validate-no-key @v3-1 @invariant @BR-RULE-260 @validate-delivery
  Scenario: BR-RULE-260 -- validate_content_delivery does NOT require idempotency_key
    Given a content standard "std-262" exists
    And a validate_content_delivery request with standards_id and records but no idempotency_key
    When the Buyer Agent invokes validate_content_delivery with standards_id "std-262"
    Then the operation succeeds
    And idempotency_key is not a required field for validate_content_delivery
    # BR-260: required set for validate_content_delivery is [standards_id, records] only

  @T-UC-024-policy-violation-details @v3-1 @error-details @policy-violation @ext-c
  Scenario: POLICY_VIOLATION error returns policy reference and violated rules
    Given a content artifact that breaches a referenced governance policy
    When the Buyer Agent calls validate_content_delivery on the artifact
    Then the per-record verdict should be "fail"
    And the error code should be "POLICY_VIOLATION"
    And the error details should include policy_id and a non-empty violated_rules array
    And the error details should include a policy_url where the full policy can be reviewed
    And the error should include "suggestion" field
    # POST-F2: policy reference is structured, not free text
    # POST-F3: buyer can fetch policy text and revise
