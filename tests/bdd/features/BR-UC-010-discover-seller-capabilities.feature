# Locally reconciled to AdCP 3.1.1 on 2026-07-13 per #1592 (P0 audit salesagent-y2vz).
# Local edits survive semantic merge (project policy); true divergences to be mirrored upstream.
# Spec authority: adcp tag v3.1.1 — dist/schemas/3.1.1/protocol/get-adcp-capabilities-response.json

# Retired 2026-07-13 (P0.4 reconcile):
#   - @T-UC-010-ext-e-gap: pinned non-echo as expected while its siblings assert the spec-true
#     echo; context echo is a MUST at 3.1.1 (core/protocol-envelope.json "MUST preserve
#     byte-for-byte") and machine-graded by capability-discovery.yaml — the gap is documented
#     by XFAIL-EXPECTED comments on the echo scenarios instead.
#   - @T-UC-010-features-boundaries: vacuous outline (no observable expected values); its
#     negative boundaries are concrete rows in @T-UC-010-features-partitions now.
#   - @T-UC-010-v31-agent-signing-key-bounds and @T-UC-010-v31-agent-encryption-key-bounds:
#     adagents.json scope, not capabilities-response scope — signing_keys[]/encryption_keys[]
#     live on authorized_agents[*] per core/authorized-agent-base.json and are never returned
#     by get_adcp_capabilities; re-scope to an adagents.json-publication suite if needed.
#   - @T-UC-010-v31-account-sandbox row 4 ("capability not declared, sandbox provisioning
#     requested"): sandbox provisioning happens at sync_accounts time — rescoped to UC-011
#     (the UC-011 feature owner is adding the sync_accounts-side scenario).
#
# Transport policy (#1592): every scenario runs on all 4 transports (impl, a2a, mcp, rest)
# via harness parametrization — When steps are transport-neutral, the auth outline
# (@T-UC-010-auth) included: it once carried a channel column and an invalid-token pair
# (@T-UC-010-ext-c-a2a / @T-UC-010-ext-c-mcp) grading A2A against MCP, and both are gone,
# because auth policy is a property of the tool, not of the channel.

Feature: BR-UC-010 Discover Seller Capabilities

  Scenario: not_provided — Not provided (no protocol filter), discover complete capabilities
    Given a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the tenant offers products in channels "display", "social", "ctv"
    And the tenant has registered publisher partnerships with domains "news.com", "sports.com"
    And the adapter provides targeting capabilities including geo
    And the tenant billing policy is configured as operator, agent
    And the tenant account is configured for sandbox: false in response (explicit production)
    When the Buyer Agent calls get_adcp_capabilities
    Then the response is compliant with the get_adcp_capabilities spec
    And the response should include adcp.major_versions containing 3
    And adcp.idempotency.supported should equal true
    And adcp.idempotency.replay_ttl_seconds should be an integer between 3600 and 604800
    And the response should include supported_protocols containing "media_buy"
    And account.supported_billing should equal [operator, agent]
    And account.sandbox should equal false
    And media_buy.features should have boolean flags inline_creative_management, property_list_filtering, catalog_management and committed_metrics_supported
    And media_buy.supported_pricing_models should be a non-empty unique array of pricing-model enum values
    And media_buy.execution.targeting.geo_countries should equal true
    And media_buy.execution.targeting.geo_regions should equal true
    And the response should include media_buy.portfolio with publisher_domains "news.com", "sports.com"
    And the response should include media_buy.portfolio with primary_channels "display", "social", "ctv"
    And last_updated should be an RFC 3339 date-time string
    # Former @T-UC-010-main-mcp / @T-UC-010-main-rest twins merged 2026-07-13: after de-pinning

  Scenario: one adapter-derived section degrading does not take the others with it
    Given a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the adapter resolves but enumerating its channels fails
    When the Buyer Agent calls get_adcp_capabilities
    Then the response is compliant with the get_adcp_capabilities spec

    # ENUMERATION raises while the adapter class itself resolves fine — and pins that
    # the other two survive.
    # Without this, the natural refactor (resolve the adapter inside the same
    # try/except that maps the channels) discards a perfectly good adapter class on a
    # channel-mapping failure, and supported_pricing_models then vanishes SILENTLY:

    # cannot tell "this seller has none" from "the lookup failed" — the quiet-failure
    # class CLAUDE.md bans. Nothing else in the corpus distinguishes "adapter gone"
    # from "one thing about it failed", so nothing else catches the cascade.

    # only requires that what IS emitted is honest.

  Scenario Outline: Authentication policy for capabilities discovery
    Given a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the tenant has full capabilities configured
    And the Buyer has <token_state> authentication
    When the Buyer Agent invokes get_adcp_capabilities
    Then the response is compliant with the get_adcp_capabilities spec
    And the response should be <outcome>
    And a success outcome should carry adcp.major_versions, adcp.idempotency, supported_protocols and the media_buy section
    # INV-1 (no token -> full data), INV-2 (valid token -> full data),
    # INV-3 (invalid token -> AUTH_INVALID, recovery terminal: presented and rejected),
    # INV-4 (a caller that IS served gets the same data whatever its auth state).
    # A success <outcome> is graded as a non-error completed discovery envelope: no wire
    # error envelope was produced and the spec-required top-level blocks (adcp,
    # supported_protocols) are present (salesagent-ytq6, was existence-only "response is not
    # None").

    Examples:
      | partition_boundary            | token_state | outcome |

    # no_tenant expected now includes adcp.idempotency (schema-required inside adcp — the

    # is not a field of the 3.1.1 response).
    # Vague expected columns pinned (salesagent-tmpd): full_response → the concrete top-level
    # key-set + account.supported_billing non-empty + adcp.idempotency present; adapter_fail /
    # no_principal "default targeting" → the exact production default {geo_countries: true,
    # geo_regions: true} (spec-silent on degradation — production authoritative; the same
    # concrete value is pinned by @T-UC-010-targeting-partitions' adapter_unavailable_defaults

    # Partially graded: production emits the constant require_human (shipped #1721 C5) — that row

    # NEW at 3.1.1: closed enum [auto_approve, require_human] — not a workflow, an
    # applicability signal; require_human is a worst-case ceiling across the portfolio; when
    # ABSENT approval behavior is legacy-unspecified and runners SHOULD NOT treat omission as
    # an affirmative auto-approval claim (hence the omitted row asserts absence, not a default).

  Scenario Outline: governance-aware — opt-in to governance-denial grading
    Given a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the tenant governance consultation is configured as <configured>

    # never runs — it does not xfail on a graded production gap.
    # NEW at 3.1.1 (default false): conformance declaration that the seller consults a
    # registered governance agent (sync_governance + outbound check_governance) before

    # grading; false/absent -> runners skip those storyboards. Independent of baseline

  @T-UC-010-v31-vendor-metric-optimization @v31 @main-flow @post-s31
  Scenario: vendor-metric-optimization — seller-level rollup of vendor-metric goal support
    Given a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And at least one tenant product declares vendor_metric_optimization with supported targets ["cost_per"]
    When the Buyer Agent calls get_adcp_capabilities
    Then the response is compliant with the get_adcp_capabilities spec
    And media_buy.vendor_metric_optimization should be present
    And media_buy.vendor_metric_optimization.supported_targets should equal ["cost_per"]
    And each supported_targets value should be one of "cost_per", "threshold_rate"
    # DORMANT: no Given/Then step definitions exist for this scenario yet, so it
    # never runs — it does not xfail on a graded production gap.
    # NEW at 3.1.1: seller-level rollup so buyers/runners can discover vendor_metric goal
    # scope before walking the catalog; product-level declarations remain authoritative and
    # "Sellers MUST keep this in sync with product-level vendor_metric_optimization
    # declarations". supported_targets: enum [cost_per, threshold_rate], minItems 1,
    # uniqueItems; a target-less vendor_metric goal needs no target-kind declaration.
