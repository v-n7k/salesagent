Feature: BR-UC-027 Manage Async Tasks
  As a Buyer or Seller
  I want to list, inspect, and complete asynchronous workflow tasks
  So that I can monitor task progress, review task details, and resolve pending tasks

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer has a filtered, sorted, paginated list of tasks matching query criteria
  #   POST-S2: Buyer knows the current status, type, AdCP protocol, timestamps, and progress of a specific task
  #   POST-S3: Buyer has completed a pending task and the task status is now completed or failed
  #   POST-S4: Application context from the request is echoed unchanged in the response
  #   POST-S5: Task completion is audit-logged with principal, timestamp, and status transition
  #   POST-S6: Buyer can page through task results using cursor-based pagination
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on failure
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what failed and the specific error code
  #   POST-F3: Application context is still echoed when possible
  #   POST-F4: When a task is not found, the error references the provided task_id
  #
  # Rules: BR-RULE-203..208 (6 rules, 24 invariants)

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And the Buyer Agent has an authenticated connection via MCP


  @T-UC-027-main-mcp @main-flow @list-tasks @mcp @happy-path @post-s1 @post-s4 @post-s6
  Scenario: List tasks via MCP -- no filters returns all tenant tasks with default sort
    Given the tenant has 15 workflow tasks across multiple domains and statuses
    When the Buyer Agent invokes list_tasks via MCP with no filters
    Then the response contains a tasks array with the tenant's tasks
    And the response contains query_summary with total_matching and returned counts

    And the query_summary shows sort_applied as "created_at" descending
    And the response contains pagination with has_more and cursor
    And the request context is echoed in the response
    # POST-S1: Buyer has filtered, sorted, paginated list of tasks
    # POST-S4: Context echoed unchanged
    # POST-S6: Cursor-based pagination available

  @T-UC-027-main-rest @main-flow @list-tasks @rest @happy-path @post-s1
  Scenario: List tasks via REST/A2A -- returns same schema as MCP path

    When the Buyer Agent sends a tasks_list A2A request with no filters
    Then the response conforms to tasks-list-response.json schema
    And the response contains query_summary, tasks array, and pagination
    # POST-S1: Buyer has paginated list of tasks

  @T-UC-027-main-filtered @main-flow @list-tasks @happy-path @post-s1
  Scenario: List tasks -- single status filter returns matching tasks only

    When the seller backend emits a tasks-get-response with protocol value "broadcast"
    Then schema validation rejects the response
    And the rejection identifies protocol as outside the adcp-protocol enum

  Scenario: Get task -- v3.1 response missing required protocol field is rejected by schema validation
    Given a task exists in the tenant
    When the seller backend emits a tasks-get-response that omits the protocol field
    Then schema validation rejects the response

    Given a task exists in the tenant
    When the seller backend emits a tasks-get-response carrying pre-v3.1 "domain" instead of "protocol"
    Then schema validation rejects the response

  Scenario: List vs Get -- v3.1 same task surfaces narrower list domain and broader get protocol per surface asymmetry
    Given a task with adcp-protocol "governance" exists in the tenant
    When the Buyer Agent invokes list_tasks with no filter
    And the Buyer Agent invokes get_task with the same task_id
    Then the list response tasks[] entry domain is one of "media-buy" or "signals" or absent per the narrowed enum
    And the get response protocol is "governance" from the full adcp-protocol enum
