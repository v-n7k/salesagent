Feature: BR-UC-026 Package Media Buy
  As a Buyer (via Buyer Agent)
  I want to configure packages within a media buy
  So that I can allocate budget, select pricing, assign creatives, and apply targeting to specific products

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows the package_id assigned by the seller to each created package
  #   POST-S2: Buyer knows the complete package state including budget, pricing, targeting, and creative assignments
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows the format_ids active for the package (echoed from request or defaulted)
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows the paused state of each package
  #   POST-S5: Buyer knows which format_ids still need creative assets (format_ids_to_provide)
  #   POST-S6: [DEPRECATED v3.1 -- buyer_ref removed from package-request/package/package-update] Buyer knows that deduplication was applied when the same buyer_ref was resubmitted
  #   POST-F1: Buyer knows the operation failed
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what went wrong (error code and message)
  #   POST-F3: Buyer knows how to recover (suggestion and recovery classification)

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant exists with completed setup checklist
    And the Buyer is authenticated
    And the seller has a product "prod-1" in inventory with pricing_options ["cpm-standard", "cpm-auction"]
    And the product "prod-1" supports format_ids ["banner-300x250", "banner-728x90"]



  # ONE scenario, parametrized over every transport, replacing the former
  # "Create package via MCP" and "Create package via REST" pair.
  #
  # Those two graded the same behaviour and differed only in an arbitrary budget
  # (5000 vs 10000) and in which transport their sentences named -- and the second
  # did not even agree with itself: titled REST, its Given and When said "A2A
  # task". Package creation is transport-independent, so naming a transport in a
  # scenario states nothing about the seller.
  #
  # Naming one also broke them. The @mcp / @rest tags put a scenario in
  # _TRANSPORT_SPECIFIC_TAGS, which SKIPS transport parametrization and hands the
  # steps an empty ctx on the premise that "When steps handle dispatch explicitly".
  # UC-026's When steps do not -- they go through the shared dispatch_request,
  # which refuses an unset transport. So the pair could not run on any transport at
  # all, while the untagged scenarios around them ran on three.

    # (MediaBuyDualEnv routes on media_buy_id). One literal tool name would grade
    # two of these five rows against the wrong contract, so the tool is a column.

  @T-UC-026-boundary-replacement @boundary @package_update_array_fields
  Scenario Outline: Update replacement semantics boundary validation -- <boundary_point>
    Given a package update request per replacement boundary <boundary_point>
    When the Buyer Agent sends the update_media_buy request
    Then the response is compliant with the update_media_buy spec
    And the outcome should be <outcome>

    Examples: Boundary values
      | boundary_point                                       | outcome                                    |
      | catalogs provided with one entry (replaces existing) | success                                    |
      | optimization_goals provided (replaces existing)      | success                                    |
      | creative_assignments provided (replaces existing)    | success                                    |
      | all array fields omitted (existing preserved)        | success                                    |
      | only scalar fields updated (patch semantics)         | success                                    |
      | targeting_overlay replacement (full swap)            | success                                    |
