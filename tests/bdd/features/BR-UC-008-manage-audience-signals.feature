@signals @BR-UC-008
Feature: BR-UC-008 Manage Audience Signals
  As a Buyer (via AI Agent or direct A2A)
  I want to discover and activate audience signals from the Seller Agent
  So that I can target my campaigns with relevant audience segments

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows which audience signals are available
  #   POST-S2: Buyer knows pricing options for each signal (CPM, percent_of_media, flat_fee)
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows coverage percentage for each signal
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows signal type and data provider
  #   POST-S5: Buyer knows deployment platforms
  #   POST-S6: Buyer receives signal_agent_segment_id for activation
  #   POST-S6a: Buyer knows value_type and categories/range
  #   POST-S6b: Sandbox mode indicated when active
  #   POST-S7: Signal activated/deactivated on specified platforms
  #   POST-S8: Buyer receives deployment results with activation keys
  #   POST-F1: System state unchanged on failure
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows error code and message
  #   POST-F3: Application context echoed when possible

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant is resolvable from the request context
    And at least one signals agent is registered for the tenant

  @T-UC-008-inv-050-5-desc @invariant @BR-RULE-050
  Scenario: INV-5 holds -- signal_spec matches description field
    Given the Buyer provides signal_spec "luxury"
    And a signal exists with description "Luxury auto intenders 25-54"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_signals request
    Then that signal is returned (substring match on description)

  @T-UC-008-inv-050-6-holds @invariant @BR-RULE-050
  Scenario: INV-6 holds -- max_percent excludes high percent_of_media signals
    Given the Buyer provides signal_spec "audience"
    And filters include max_percent 15
    And a signal has pricing_options with model="percent_of_media" and percent=25
    And another signal has pricing_options with model="percent_of_media" and percent=10
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_signals request
    Then the signal with percent 25 is excluded (ALL percent_of_media options exceed threshold)
    And the signal with percent 10 is returned

  @T-UC-008-inv-050-6-mixed @invariant @BR-RULE-050
  Scenario: INV-6 mixed -- signal with one percent option below threshold passes
    Given the Buyer provides signal_spec "audience"
    And filters include max_percent 15
    And a signal has two percent_of_media options: percent=10 and percent=25
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_signals request
    Then that signal is returned (at least one option has percent <= max_percent)

  @T-UC-008-inv-050-6-cross @invariant @BR-RULE-050
  Scenario: INV-6 cross-model -- max_percent does not affect CPM or flat_fee signals
    Given the Buyer provides signal_spec "audience"
    And filters include max_percent 5
    And a signal has only pricing_options with model="cpm"
    And another signal has only pricing_options with model="flat_fee"
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_signals request
    Then both signals are returned (not affected by max_percent)
