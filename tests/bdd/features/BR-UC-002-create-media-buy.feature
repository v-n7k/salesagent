Feature: BR-UC-002 Create Media Buy
  As a Buyer (via Buyer Agent)
  I want to create a media buy for advertising inventory
  So that my advertising campaign is live on the publisher's ad server

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows their media buy has been created and is activating
  #   POST-S2: Buyer can track the media buy via media_buy_id
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows each package's allocation, product, and pricing
  #   POST-S4: Buyer's advertising campaign is live (or activating) on the ad server
  #   POST-S5: Buyer receives an unambiguous success confirmation
  #   POST-S6: Buyer knows the request completed successfully
  #   POST-S7: Buyer knows their media buy is awaiting seller approval
  #   POST-S8: Seller knows there is a media buy requiring their review
  #   POST-S9: Buyer can track the pending media buy via task_id
  #   POST-S10: Buyer knows how to check approval progress
  #   POST-S11: Buyer knows the proposal was successfully executed with their total budget
  #   POST-S12: Buyer knows the media buy was rejected and the reason for rejection
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged on failure (all-or-nothing semantics)
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what failed, the specific error code, and the recovery classification
  #   POST-F3: Buyer knows how to fix the issue and retry (correctable) or escalate (terminal)

    And the response status should be "completed"
    And the response should include a "media_buy_id"
    And the response should include packages with allocations
    And each package should include product_id, budget, and pricing details

  Scenario: Async submitted envelope -- task_id matches deterministic value registered via comply_test_controller
    Given a comply_test_controller directive registered force_create_media_buy_arm with branch "submitted" and task_id "task_async_signed_io_q2"
    And the directive is keyed to the caller's authenticated sandbox account
    When the Buyer Agent sends create_media_buy under the registered sandbox account
    Then the response is compliant with the create_media_buy submitted spec
    And the response should carry status "submitted"
    And the response should carry task_id "task_async_signed_io_q2"
    And the response should NOT carry media_buy_id on the submitted envelope

  Scenario: Governance denied -- seller rejects the buy with GOVERNANCE_DENIED and propagates denial rationale
    Given the buyer's governance agent has returned decision "DENIED" with a denial reason
    And the buyer attaches the governance_decision payload to the create_media_buy request
    When the Buyer Agent sends create_media_buy with the governance_decision payload
    Then the response is compliant with the create_media_buy error spec

  @T-UC-002-storyboard-governance-denied-recovery @schema-v3.1 @v3-1 @governance @recovery
  Scenario: Governance denied recovery -- buyer shrinks the buy to within plan limits and retries successfully
    Given a previous create_media_buy attempt failed with error code "GOVERNANCE_DENIED"
    And the buyer reduces the proposed buy to within the governance agent's spending authority
    And the buyer obtains a new "APPROVED" decision from the governance agent
    When the Buyer Agent sends a corrected create_media_buy with the new APPROVED governance_decision
    Then the response is compliant with the create_media_buy success spec

  Scenario: Inventory list references that resolve to zero inventory -- zero-forecast or informative error, never silent success
    Given the buyer references a property_list whose entries do not match any seller inventory
    And the buyer references a collection_list whose entries do not match any seller inventory
    When the Buyer Agent sends create_media_buy with the no-match list references in targeting_overlay
    Then the response is compliant with the create_media_buy spec
    And the response should NOT be a silent success with normal forecast numbers
    And one of the following two outcomes should be observed:

    Given the buyer holds a property_list (agent_url, list_id) that matches seller inventory

    When the Buyer Agent sends create_media_buy with property_list and collection_list in package targeting_overlay

    Given the buyer attaches measurement_terms that the seller will not accept
    When the Buyer Agent sends create_media_buy with the unworkable measurement_terms
    Then the response is compliant with the create_media_buy error spec
    And the operation should fail

  Scenario: Media buy created without creatives sits in pending_creatives until sync_creatives completes, then transitions to pending_start
    Given the buyer sends create_media_buy without inline creatives
    When the Buyer Agent sends the create_media_buy request
    Then the response is compliant with the create_media_buy success spec
    And the response should carry status "pending_creatives"
    When the buyer subsequently completes sync_creatives for all required creatives
    Then the buy's status should transition to "pending_start"
    # pending_creatives_to_start storyboard: when a buy is created without inline
    # creatives, the seller persists it in pending_creatives. Once the buyer calls
    # sync_creatives and all required creatives reach an acceptable status, the
    # buy transitions to pending_start. The state transition is observable via
    # get_media_buys (covered in UC-019) but the anchor is the buy state on UC-002.
    # pending_creatives_to_start: creative sync unblocks pending_creatives -> pending_start
