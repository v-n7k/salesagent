"""
BDD test configuration and fixtures.

Every scenario runs against real production code through harness environments:
  - UC-005 (Creative Formats): CreativeFormatsEnv
  - UC-004 (Delivery Metrics): DeliveryPollEnv / WebhookEnv / CircuitBreakerEnv

There is no stub mode — steps call the harness directly and assert on
real response objects.

Unimplemented scenarios (missing step definitions) are auto-xfailed at runtime
via ``pytest_runtest_makereport``. No metadata or @pending tags needed — the
code is the source of truth.

Scenarios for unimplemented *production* features use explicit ``xfail`` markers
with a reason (e.g., "MCP wrapper does not accept disclosure_positions").

    Why a parse and not a tighter substring match. The predicate this replaces asked
    ``"scope=per-transport" in reason``, and that is satisfied by any text CONTAINING the
    phrase -- including a sentence *describing* the token. Measured: retyping the
    declaration at :687 while leaving the prose at :706 ("scope=per-transport because each
    transport enforces ... independently") changed the collected set by ZERO rows. The
    declaration was decorative and the English sentence was load-bearing, by accident.
    A substring predicate cannot tell a declaration from a description of one; only
    position can, so ONLY the leading run of ``key=value`` tokens is read — the
    declaration ends at the first word that is not one, and everything after it is prose
    the parser never consults.

    Free text returns None rather than raising: 62 reasons in this tree are prose, three
    of them carrying unrelated ``k=`` pairs, and sweeping them is not this change's job.
    Only a reason that ANNOUNCES itself typed -- by OPENING with a run of ``key=value``
    tokens, in any order -- is held to the vocabulary. A reason that merely mentions one
    later is prose.

    The residue, stated rather than papered over: a typo in ``cause=`` ITSELF -- or in the
    leading token's key, which is the same thing -- degrades the reason into free text and
    returns None. So this DETECTS an unknown value; it does not make one unrepresentable.
    Leading whitespace is tolerated (``lstrip``) so that a reason indented in a source

    # Scenarios that xfail(strict=True) waste runtime running the same failure
    # path on every transport. Keep one canonical transport running (so the
    # xfail still proves out and an xpass is still caught when production catches
    # up) and deselect the redundant ones.
    #
    # That rationale holds only when the failure IS transport-independent. It is
    # not always: an obligation each transport enforces separately fails three
    # times for three reasons, and each has to xpass on its own when production
    # catches up — deselecting two of them would grade a cross-transport MUST on
    # one transport and call it covered.
    #
    # So the exemption is keyed on the xfail reason declaring `scope=per-transport`,
    # not on a list of node ids. A node list is an allowlist under another name and
    # rots the moment someone adds a row; a declared property is inherited by every
    # future row that carries it. See the cause taxonomy the UC-003 revision rows
    # use above (`cause=... scope=... ref=...`).
    # IMPL was dropped from the BDD default parametrization (#1417), so
    # a2a is now the canonical transport that always runs; mcp/rest are the
    # redundant transports deselected when the scenario carries a strict xfail.
    # (Previously impl was canonical; keeping a2a preserves the "still xfail on
    # wire, not deselected-to-nothing" guarantee for the impl-exclusive ledger.)
