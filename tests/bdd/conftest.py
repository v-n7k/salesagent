"""
BDD test configuration and fixtures.

Every scenario runs against real production code through harness environments:
  - UC-005 (Creative Formats): CreativeFormatsEnv
  - UC-004 (Delivery Metrics): DeliveryPollEnv / WebhookEnv / CircuitBreakerEnv

There is no stub mode — steps call the harness directly and assert on
real response objects.

Unimplemented scenarios (missing step definitions) are auto-xfailed at runtime
via ``pytest_runtest_makereport``. No metadata or @pending tags needed — the
code is the source of truth.

Scenarios for unimplemented *production* features use explicit ``xfail`` markers
with a reason (e.g., "MCP wrapper does not accept disclosure_positions").

    The judgement was already in this file and was simply not reached:
    ``pytest_bdd_step_func_lookup_error`` classifies a missing binding as dormancy,
    and ``_classify_strict_xfail_dormancy`` fails a strict-xfail that CLAIMS a
    production gap when the cause is that classification. But the auto-convert's own
    reason claims nothing, so it sailed past the check written for it. This routes it
    through the same vocabulary instead of adding a third rule beside the two
    (#1929).

    The key is published as a ``user_property`` because pytest-json-report does NOT
    serialize ``wasxfail``: the reason string is invisible in the JSON reports, so the
    only trace of dormancy there is the exception class inside a traceback. Measuring

    # Per the graduation workflow, both were inspected before the rows came out rather
    # than removed on the strength of a green mark: the scenarios carry the full
    # obligation (the replay Then counts approval workflow steps against a pre-retry
    # baseline and asserts the per-creative `changes` list stayed empty; the conflict
    # Then asserts code AND recovery through the wire envelope via

    # ── UC-006 ROUTE PARTITION ──
    # These 16 Scenario Outlines disagree ROW TO ROW, which is why they are here and not
    # in _UC006_WIRED_SCENARIOS: a route matches on a scenario's markers and cannot say
    # "these Examples rows, not those". Wiring them wakes 128 passing nodes; these 70 are
    # the rows that do not pass, parked one row at a time.
    #
    # MEASURED, not inferred from the group. The uc006 catch-all's xfail_reason was set to
    # None locally and the file run against a real Postgres (410 passed / 209 failed /
    # 85 xfailed over its 617 catch-all nodes); each row below carries ITS OWN blocker,
    # and a row is parked only if a node of that row actually failed. A row whose siblings
    # fail is not parked -- that is a row nobody looked at.
    #
    # The reasons are BLOCKER CATEGORIES, deliberately. 81% of what wiring reveals is
    # test-side (missing step definitions, steps that do not cover their own Examples rows,
    # payloads the malformation gate refuses), so "production behaviour not implemented"
    # would reproduce the catch-all's own mislabelling one level finer. Where the blocker
    # is unverified this says so rather than guessing.
    #
    # strict=True is the consumer's default here, so a parked row that starts passing
    # becomes XPASS(strict) and fails -- the list cannot rot quietly.
    # No UC-006 rows are parked here any more. What stood here, and why each is live:
    # boundary-approval's ai-powered row read a column the mapping table does not have
    # (workflow_step_id); the assignments-structure "entry missing a field" rows now send
    # the entry itself, which the request schema refuses; the generative no-GEMINI-key
    # row reads CONFIGURATION_ERROR on the entry, as ext-i does; the validation_mode
    # "partial" row names the code; main-lenient-warnings built its two valid packages
    # from one factory-default id, so they collapsed into one assignment; and the
    # assignment-weight / provenance rows are described where the Given changed.
    # ── UPSTREAM SPEC BUG: adcontextprotocol/adcp#7338 ──
    # Row-level, not tag-level, and that distinction was MEASURED. Only the "-valid" rows
    # build a success response and therefore validate assets against the pinned schema; the
    # "-INVALID_REQUEST" rows are rejected before any response is serialized. Ledgering the
    # whole tag turned all 16 error rows into XPASS(strict) failures -- an xfail that hides
    # working behavior is worse than the bug it parks. Split measured from run
    # innet_070926_0757: 68 failing rows, every one ending "-valid"; 16 others, every one
    # ending "-INVALID_REQUEST".
    #
    # NOT our formats. tests/fixtures/creative_formats/reference_formats.json records its
    # provenance as {'image': 'adcp-creative-agent', 'pin': '467fd93d7711'} -- captured from
    # the REFERENCE creative agent at the v3.1.1 tag -- and 4 of the 16 files under the
    # spec's own formats/canonical/ declare pixel_tracker assets. The spec's reference
    # catalogue emits what the spec's response schema rejects.
    #
    # Checked against the newest upstream before ledgering, not assumed: v3.1.20 (latest
    # stable) still admits the same 15, and v3.2.0-rc.1 restructures the oneOf into a nested
    # item_type/asset_type discriminator and still admits the same 15 while its asset-union
    # grows to 21. Refreshing the fixture or bumping the pin does not fix it.
    #
    # Graduates when #7338 lands and the pin moves past it. NO PR IS PLANNED FROM HERE
    # (decided 2026-09-09), so do not read this as work in flight — it graduates only if
    # upstream fixes it independently. A local schema overlay was considered and rejected:
    # tests/helpers/adcp_pinned_schema.py deliberately RAISES on a name present in both the
    # pinned tree and schemas/, because two live definitions of one contract is the exact
    # condition that tree exists to avoid, and a copied format.json would freeze the whole
    # file behind the pin the way the old vendored fixture tree already did once.
    #
    # The fix shape is measured, so whoever picks this up upstream need not re-derive it:
    #   - the reference asset matches 0 of the 16 existing oneOf branches, so adding one
    #     introduces no ambiguity;
    #   - a branch of allOf[baseIndividualAsset] + item_type/asset_type consts and NO
    #     requirements $ref already validates it, because baseIndividualAsset does not set
    #     additionalProperties:false, so event/method/requirements pass through
    #     (IndividualZipAsset and IndividualBriefAsset are the existing ref-less precedent);
    #   - five types need branches: pixel_tracker, vast_tracker, daast_tracker, card,
    #     published_post.
    # The underlying defect is that core/format.json HAND-COPIES the asset union instead of
    # deriving from core/assets/asset-union.json. Five branches fix this instance; deriving
    # is what stops the next drift.
    #
    # The storyboard does NOT provide a second opinion here. compliance/universal/
    # schema-validation.yaml step list_formats_match carries `check: response_schema` against
    # creative/list-creative-formats-response.json, which $refs the same core/format.json --
    # but that storyboard is not selected for this agent (22 of the 198 shipped storyboards
    # are; the step appears in neither storyboard_collected.json nor known_failures.txt).
    # This BDD check is the only thing grading it.

    Why a parse and not a tighter substring match. The predicate this replaces asked
    ``"scope=per-transport" in reason``, and that is satisfied by any text CONTAINING the
    phrase -- including a sentence *describing* the token. Measured: retyping the
    declaration at :687 while leaving the prose at :706 ("scope=per-transport because each
    transport enforces ... independently") changed the collected set by ZERO rows. The
    declaration was decorative and the English sentence was load-bearing, by accident.
    A substring predicate cannot tell a declaration from a description of one; only
    position can, so ONLY the leading run of ``key=value`` tokens is read — the
    declaration ends at the first word that is not one, and everything after it is prose
    the parser never consults.

    Free text returns None rather than raising: 62 reasons in this tree are prose, three
    of them carrying unrelated ``k=`` pairs, and sweeping them is not this change's job.
    Only a reason that ANNOUNCES itself typed -- by OPENING with a run of ``key=value``
    tokens, in any order -- is held to the vocabulary. A reason that merely mentions one
    later is prose.

    The residue, stated rather than papered over: a typo in ``cause=`` ITSELF -- or in the
    leading token's key, which is the same thing -- degrades the reason into free text and
    returns None. So this DETECTS an unknown value; it does not make one unrepresentable.
    Leading whitespace is tolerated (``lstrip``) so that a reason indented in a source
    literal is still recognised as typed rather than silently becoming prose.

        # from the server's, and the buys are simply not there. It presents as
        # "Filter 'active' returned no media buys" and "got IDs: []", which reads
        # like a filtering bug and is not one.

        # the escape-hatch detectors in
        # test_architecture_e2e_rest_escape_hatches.py, and a parametrize-time

    # xfail still proves out and an xpass is still caught when production catches
    # up) and deselect the redundant ones.
    #
    # That rationale holds only when the failure IS transport-independent. It is
    # not always: an obligation each transport enforces separately fails three
    # times for three reasons, and each has to xpass on its own when production
    # catches up — deselecting two of them would grade a cross-transport MUST on
    # one transport and call it covered.
    #
    # So the exemption is keyed on the xfail reason declaring `scope=per-transport`,
    # not on a list of node ids. A node list is an allowlist under another name and
    # rots the moment someone adds a row; a declared property is inherited by every
    # future row that carries it. See the cause taxonomy the UC-003 revision rows
    # use above (`cause=... scope=... ref=...`).

    # a2a is now the canonical transport that always runs; mcp/rest are the
    # redundant transports deselected when the scenario carries a strict xfail.
    # (Previously impl was canonical; keeping a2a preserves the "still xfail on
    # wire, not deselected-to-nothing" guarantee for the impl-exclusive ledger.)

    same logical operation with substituted enum members — the R0801 shape the
    DRY invariant treats as a defect, against a duplication baseline that may
    only shrink.

    A SEQUENCE of e2e members, not one. The single-member signature is why the suite
    graded four transports rather than six: ``McpE2EDispatcher`` and ``A2AE2EDispatcher``
    have been built and registered in ``DISPATCHERS`` since #1858, and nothing here could
    name them, so ``E2E_MCP`` and ``E2E_A2A`` appeared nowhere under ``tests/bdd/``. The
    limit was the parameter, not the harness. The admin branch passes a one-element
    sequence and is unchanged in behaviour.

    The pytest ids are DERIVED, not passed. Both transport enums are ``StrEnum``\\ s whose
    value IS the id — ``Transport.E2E_MCP`` is ``"e2e_mcp"``, ``AdminTransport.E2E`` is
    ``"e2e_admin"`` — so a parallel list of strings restated what the members already
    carry and could disagree with them. That disagreement would not be cosmetic: the id is
    what ``tox.ini``'s ``-k "e2e_rest or e2e_mcp or ..."`` matches on, so a typo'd or

    Live-server e2e shares ONE database and the server process commits

    transports get (via the per-test integration_db) is impossible here. Instead
    empty every data table so each scenario's harness setup recreates exactly the
    rows it needs into a clean DB. The server reads the DB live, so it observes
    the reset immediately. alembic_version is preserved (schema stays).

    DELETE rather than TRUNCATE, and the lock mode is the whole point.
    TRUNCATE takes an AccessExclusiveLock on every table it names, one relation
    at a time, in whatever order ``pg_tables`` returned them. The server running
    against this same database sweeps it from background schedulers --
    ``delivery_webhook_scheduler`` every DELIVERY_WEBHOOK_INTERVAL (5s under
    run_all_tests.sh) and ``media_buy_status_scheduler`` every 60s -- and each
    sweep reads ``media_buys`` FIRST and a second table (webhook_delivery_log,
    creative_assignments, creatives) LATER in the SAME transaction, taking an
    AccessShareLock on each. AccessShareLock and AccessExclusiveLock conflict, the
    two orders are opposite, and neither side knows about the other: a textbook
    ABBA cycle. Postgres broke it by killing whichever party it picked, which
    surfaced as one rotating ``DeadlockDetected`` per full in-network run, always
    in scenario SETUP and never on an assertion (#2048).

    DELETE takes a RowExclusiveLock, which does not conflict with AccessShareLock
    at all, so the reset can neither block nor be blocked by a concurrent reader
    and the cycle has nowhere to form. Do NOT "fix" a recurrence by retrying or by
    serialising the suite -- both leave the cycle in place.

    Emptying every table makes the delete order irrelevant, so FK triggers are
    suppressed for the transaction (``session_replication_role = replica``, SET
    LOCAL so it reverts at COMMIT) instead of topologically sorting 40+ tables --
    that is the property ``CASCADE`` was supplying. It needs a superuser, which
    the e2e Postgres role already is (run_all_tests.sh calls pg_terminate_backend
    on other backends with it); if that ever stops being true this raises loudly
    rather than silently leaving rows behind.

#: UC-006 scenarios CreativeSyncEnv provably serves, keyed by SCENARIO IDENTITY.
#:
#: Identity, not behavioural family, because the family tags do not partition along
#: the wired boundary: measured over all 617 catch-all scenarios, only 102 of the 338
#: that pass are selectable by a family tag whose every member passes -- @partition,
#: @boundary, @format-id and the rest each span passing, failing and step-less
#: scenarios at once, so wiring by family forces failures awake alongside passes.
#: By identity the same measurement selects 210 nodes across these 49 scenarios, every
#: one of which passes on every transport and every Examples row.
#:
#: MEASURED, not assumed: the catch-all row below and this row build
#: the SAME env, so "wiring" is not building a harness -- it is naming the scenarios the
#: existing one serves. Setting the catch-all's xfail_reason to None locally and running
#: the file against a real Postgres gives 410 passed / 209 failed / 85 xfailed; grouped
#: by identity, 49 scenarios pass on every node, 23 are step-less, 20 carry their own
#: xfail and 7 fail on production defects. These are the 49.
#:
#: The rest stay on the catch-all with their blockers named per bucket below. Adding
#: an entry here GROWS the executing surface; it exempts nothing from grading.
#: Empty: every UC-006 scenario parked here has either been corrected to the pin and
