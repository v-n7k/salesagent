"""Record the request payload every graded BDD dispatch actually SENT.

WHY OUTCOMES ARE NOT ENOUGH. ``scripts/audit/compare_runs.py`` diffs per-nodeid
outcomes and refuses to summarise, which is the right outer check and is not
sufficient on its own: a migration that NORMALIZES a seeded payload -- repairing
an invalid literal into a valid one, or flipping which production branch runs --
moves no outcome at all. The scenario stays green and grades a different request
than it used to. This module makes the request itself a measured artifact, so
that repair is a diff instead of a silence.

THE THREE-VALUED CONTRACT, and the one it exists to prevent. Every nodeid the
run executed gets a row, INCLUDING the 66% that dispatch nothing (5421 of 8182
measured, salesagent-ryzil.2) -- because "ran and dispatched nothing" and "did
not run" must not be the same artifact. The comparator's verdicts are SAME /
CHANGED / NOT_MEASURED, and a nodeid the baseline recorded that this run did not
FAILS. A missing measurement reading as "no change" is exactly the defect
salesagent-b341x.18 removed from the census (commit 75f4317f6); reintroducing it
inside the gate built to catch silent repairs would be indefensible.

SERIALIZATION MUST REFUSE, NEVER DROP. ``tests/harness/_base.json_safe`` is
reused -- it already converts models, enums, datetimes and Decimals exactly the
way a wire body does -- but it is NOT TOTAL: 33 of 2905 real payloads (1.14%)
hold a value ``json.dump`` cannot write (30 pydantic ``AnyUrl``, 9 bare
``object()`` OMIT sentinels). The scan's own first full run lost 4 of 8 worker
shards to a silently truncated artifact because of it. So every payload is
round-tripped through ``json`` AT CAPTURE TIME with a capture-local ``default=``
that maps the two known classes and RAISES on anything else, loudly, at the
dispatch that produced it. A half-written capture that reads as a complete
"before" is this gate's worst possible failure.

``identity`` IS TOKENIZED, NOT RECORDED. It rides in the dispatched kwargs bag on
84 dispatches but is not a request field -- ``_deliver_via_client`` pops it before
the wire. Recording its contents would (i) write auth tokens into an artifact and
(ii) mark every such row CHANGED forever, since the tenant, principal and token
are all factory-minted. What a migration could actually change here is whether a
scenario dispatches WITHOUT auth, so that is what is kept: absent / none /
supplied. See the ``_IDENTITY_*`` tokens below.

Structure is modelled on ``tests/bdd/scenario_liveness.py``, which already solved
xdist shipping (workers ship on ``config.workeroutput``, the controller merges in
``pytest_testnodedown``), controller-only writing, the collect-only guard and the
run-scope block. Each of those was re-read against that file rather than assumed.

Writes ``$BDD_PAYLOAD_ARTIFACT`` (tox sets it per BDD env, under ``{toxworkdir}``;
``run_all_tests.sh`` copies it into ``$RESULTS_DIR/payloads/``). It must NOT land
at the ``test-results/`` root the way ``bdd_scenario_liveness.json`` does: that
file is overwritten every run, which would destroy the "before" this gate needs.
