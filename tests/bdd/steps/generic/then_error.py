# UNBOUND, AND KEPT DELIBERATELY. No feature carries any of the seven sentences below —
# checked by literal grep and by matching each pattern against all 49534 sentences
# rendered from every feature's Examples through pytest-bdd's own FeatureParser. They are
# not dead weight, though, and deleting them would destroy the only record that these
# remediations were ever identified: each one names a specific thing a rejection should
# tell the buyer to DO, and no scenario grades any of them.
#
# Measured against CODE_TABLE, which owns the suggestion text a code resolves to:
#
#   - `then_suggestion_auth` is the weak one. AUTH_MISSING's own entry reads "provide
#     credentials via the auth header and retry", so its keyword test passes on the table
#     text alone. Asserting the CODE is strictly stronger — it pins WHICH code as well —
#     which is why nothing should bind this sentence as written.
#   - The other six demand wording NO code's entry carries. INVALID_REQUEST resolves to
#     "check request parameters and fix" and VALIDATION_ERROR to "review error details and
#     fix field values"; neither says DisclosurePosition, positions, duplicates, FormatId,
#     or agent_url. So those six record obligations production does not meet, which were
#     never ledgered because no scenario reaches them.
#
# Those scenarios are not written yet. When they are, the assertion should
# be re-expressed against the CODE plus the sanctioned wire oracle rather than against
# prose: core/error.json leaves `suggestion` free-form text the seller may reword, and
# these keyword tests would grade one seller's phrasing.
