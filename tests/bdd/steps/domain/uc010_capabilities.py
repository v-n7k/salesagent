"""UC-010 step definitions: get_adcp_capabilities discovery (batch 1).

Batch 1 covers the envelope + account families (#1592 / #1825):
main flow, auth policy, no-tenant minimal, account.* outlines, protocols
filter, context echo, and version negotiation. Batches 2-3 (media_buy
families, long tail) land behind the conftest wired-tags gate.

Wire-assert philosophy (tests/CLAUDE.md § wire_response): Then steps grade
the SERIALIZED wire (``ctx["wire_response"]``) via dotted-path resolution,
not the coerced typed payload. Absent means the key is NOT on the wire —
a JSON null would be schema-invalid for these optional-object fields and
is deliberately not treated as absent.

Givens describing tenant-config surface production does not have yet record
intent in ``ctx["capabilities_config"]``; those scenarios xfail at the Then
— the correct red for the S1/S2/S3 slices (do NOT invent config columns here).
