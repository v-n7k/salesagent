"""UC-005 roundtrip: format_id advertised on products resolves through list_creative_formats.

Scenario T-UC-005-storyboard-format-id-roundtrip-from-products (@format-id-roundtrip):
The Buyer Agent captures a format_id from get_products and sends it to list_creative_formats.
The sales agent MUST return the format it advertised — an empty formats[] is a compliance failure.

# Production filters list_creative_formats on the (agent_url, id) pair via

# contains only the single matching entry regardless of catalog order --
# formats[0] is always the captured pair.
#
# PIN-EXPRESSIBLE ON PURPOSE. The obligation here is format_id RESOLUTION — the
# seller returns the format it advertised, verbatim — not any particular asset shape.
# The previous seed, display_300x250_image, carries three `pixel_tracker` assets, and
# the pinned AdCP 3.1.1 format-declaration union (core/format.json, 16 branches: image,
# video, audio, text, markdown, html, css, javascript, zip, vast, daast, url, webhook,
# brief, catalog) has no such branch — verified directly against the pinned schema. So
# full schema validation of the returned format reports one violation per tracker,
# and the roundtrip obligation could not be graded through it.
#
# That is a CATALOG-vs-PIN gap (the fixture was captured from the reference agent
# after the pin; 45 of its 57 formats carry pixel_tracker), owned by #1998. It is not
# a defect in format_id resolution, and it must not cost us the grading of format_id
# resolution — which is what xfailing this scenario did. Seeding one of the 12
# pin-expressible formats keeps the storyboard obligation live on all three
# transports while #1998 carries the catalog.
#
# NOTE for whoever fixes #1998: the manifest-side core/assets/asset-union.json DOES
# carry pixel-tracker-asset.json at 3.1.1. The union reached through core/format.json
# does not. Chasing the wrong file is the easy mistake here.
