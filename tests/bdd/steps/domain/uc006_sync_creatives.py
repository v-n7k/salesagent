"""BDD step definitions for UC-006: Sync Creatives — account resolution scenarios.

Focuses on account partition/boundary scenarios that test resolve_account()
in the sync_creatives context. The account resolution logic is shared with
UC-002 (create_media_buy) — same resolve_account(), same exceptions.

Steps dispatch through CreativeSyncEnv which exercises sync_creatives wrappers
(MCP/A2A/REST) that call enrich_identity_with_account() → resolve_account().

HOW A CREATIVE IS BUILT HERE, because the next step written in this file will copy
whatever it finds. Every creative item goes through
``CreativeAssetRequestFactory.payload()`` — the REQUEST model's factory, never a
hand-typed dict and never ``CreativeAssetFactory``, which builds the RESPONSE model.
Three rules follow from its override contract (tests/factories/request.py):

* ``format_id`` is ALWAYS stated. The factory's default normalises ``AGENT_URL`` to
  a trailing slash and names ``creative.adcontextprotocol.org``, while these
  scenarios talk to ``env.DEFAULT_AGENT_URL`` — inheriting it would silently change
  WHICH creative agent the payload names.
* ``assets`` is stated only when it differs from the conformant baseline. A step
  that says nothing about assets means "any valid asset will do", which is exactly
  what the baseline supplies.
* A deliberate wrongness is an OVERRIDE plus a declaration: ``assets=OMIT`` /
  ``format_id=None`` for the bytes, ``malformed(kind, why, ..., pin_rejects=...)``
  around them for the claim. Dropping the override lets a factory default repair the
  scenario, and ``assert_declared_malformations`` reports that at dispatch.
