"""Domain step definitions for BR-SECURITY-001 (#1587 / salesagent-prkv.18).

Formalizes, as a Gherkin scenario graded across a2a/mcp/rest, the
obligation that an untyped exception raised inside a dispatched skill's
business logic never puts its own text on the buyer-facing wire.
AdCP 3.1.1 dist/docs/3.1.1/building/implementation/transport-errors.mdx,
Security Considerations MUST-NOT list.

Given: "a tenant is configured for product discovery" is reused from
    tests/bdd/steps/domain/uc_get_products_inventory.py (already registered
    as a pytest-bdd step by that module) — not redefined here.
When: dispatch_request(ctx, ...) — the ONE sanctioned writer of ctx["result"].
Then: TWO assertions, both required (neither alone closes the gap) —
    positively pins the observation to THIS injected fault via the server-side
    boundary log (record_boundary_error attaches the original exception with
    exc_info, so the pin is exception-TYPE IDENTITY, not a substring), and
    negatively asserts the fault's own (plainly-internal-looking) marker text is
    absent from the FULL wire envelope via assert_no_marker_in_envelope.

    The positive pin CANNOT live on the wire any more, and that is the point of
    this epic: the buyer-facing message is now a function of the error CODE via
    CODE_TABLE, so it can no longer carry type(exc).__name__ — precisely the
    leak-adjacent behaviour this scenario grades. The observability channel is
    where the fault's identity legitimately survives.
    Not graded on e2e_rest: inject_untyped_exception is e2e_unsupported
    (tests/harness/_base.py), and an out-of-process server's logs are not
    visible to caplog.
