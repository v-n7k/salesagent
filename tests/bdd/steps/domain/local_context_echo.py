"""Steps for local-context-echo-every-outcome.feature.

The scenarios grade ONE obligation across five outcomes: whatever leaves the
seller carries the buyer's `context` object unchanged. The pinned authority and
the upstream gap are stated in the feature file's header; this module is only
the wiring.

THE DOCUMENT IS A FACTORY BASELINE, PERTURBED ONE FIELD AT A TIME. Each tool's
request factory (``tests/factories/request.py``) builds the conformant baseline,
and ``payload(**overrides)`` applies the scenario's perturbations AFTER the model
dump, so a wrong-typed field or an omitted one reaches the wire as written -- a
model could not be constructed from the bytes these scenarios send. The Givens
accumulate overrides; the When builds the document from the factory the routing
tag's tool names and hands it to ``dispatch_request(ctx, **payload)``
(``tests/bdd/steps/generic/_dispatch.py``), the one keyword-bag seam every
scenario dispatches through.

``tests/unit/test_architecture_harness_single_dispatch.py`` is not touched by
any of this: what it bans is a per-env ``call_mcp``/``call_a2a`` override, a
``deliver_*`` override outside its shrink-only allowlist, and the deleted
``_last_wire_response`` stash. A raw keyword bag is none of those — it is the
existing seam's existing parameter.
