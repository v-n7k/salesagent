"""Steps for the inbound request-signature enforcement scenarios (salesagent-n78j0.1.3).

Every step here is TRANSPORT-BLIND, and that is the whole reason the file exists.
The property under test — a signed request accepted, an unsigned one refused,
identically on every transport — is a CROSS-transport property, so a step that
learned which transport it was on could not grade it: it would be four claims that
happen to be spelled alike. Signing, the posture write, the credential location and
the verification oracle are all realized by the ENV
(``tests.harness.signing_capability``, ``BaseTestEnv.declare_request_signing`` /
``signature_verifications``), which is the one place transport knowledge is allowed.

Spec grounding, pinned AdCP 3.1.1 (``adcp==6.6.0``), all in
``v3.1.1:docs/building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx``:

* :1268-1269 the composition rule — an unsigned request to a ``required_for``
  operation is refused only when the caller presents no credential the agent accepts;
* :1375 / :1462-1465 the payload escalation — a seller that SUPPORTS request signing
  MUST require a signature when the request carries webhook ``authentication``,
  "regardless of ``required_for`` membership";
* graded by ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/test-vectors/request-signing/negative/
  027-webhook-registration-authentication-unsigned.json``, whose
  ``verifier_capability`` is ``{supported: true, required_for: []}``;
* :1226 the pre-check — a verifier MUST NOT fall back to bearer-only auth when a
  MALFORMED signature is present, "even for operations not in ``required_for``", which
  is a quantifier over BUCKETS and is graded as one only by declaring each in turn;
* :1226 again, from the other side — the narrowed ``none`` bucket (this seller verifies,
  and grades this operation in no bucket) waves a signed-but-INVALID request through while
  still refusing a malformed header, which is what makes a refusal on that arm
  attributable to the credential escalation alone.

    This is the escalation's trigger, in the buyer's own words: "register this webhook,
    here are the credentials for it". WHERE those credentials sit on the wire is the
    transport's business and is genuinely NOT the same place on each one — the AdCP
    request body on REST, the ``tools/call`` arguments on MCP, and the A2A protocol
    envelope (``params.configuration.task_push_notification_config``) on A2A. The env
    owns that placement (``BaseTestEnv.credential_registrations``,
    ``_a2a_message_send_body``); the scenario states only the intent.

    AND ON A2A THAT IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE (salesagent-jj90f). The same transport also
    serves ``tasks/pushNotificationConfig/set``, where a buyer registers a webhook and
    its credentials on a JSON-RPC method of its own with no skill invocation at all. So
    this Given asks for a claim about CREDENTIALS, not about one request, and opts the
    scenario into being graded at every location the transport offers
    (``BaseTestEnv.credential_registrations``).

    ON #1721's BOUNDARY BOTH A2A LOCATIONS ARE A RECORDED GAP, and this Given is what
    keeps the gap visible rather than absent. The escalation now reads the VALIDATED
    request inside ``invoke_tool`` (``src/core/signing/webhook_credentials.py``), so it
    sees neither the ``message/send`` protocol envelope — ``on_message_send`` routes on
    the DataPart's skill and never threads ``params.configuration`` into the request —
    nor ``tasks/pushNotificationConfig/set``, which the a2a-sdk answers through handlers
    that never call the boundary (``AdCPRequestHandler`` declines it outright). Both are
    named by ``src/core/signing/verifier.py`` § "What the boundary cannot see", whose own
    conclusion is that the fix is for those handlers to reach the same boundary rather
    than for a second verifier to exist. Grading both locations is how this file keeps
    saying so; dropping either would turn the gap into something that reads as coverage.

    SAY IT PLAINLY: that makes this scenario's single When put TWO dispatches on the
    wire where the transport has two locations, which departs from this suite's
    "one request, one outcome" shape. It is worth the departure at two locations,
    where naming the accepted one in the failure is enough to say what broke. It stops
    being worth it at THREE: if a third location ever appears, switch to B1 —
    parametrise the location at the ENV level so each location is its own leg with its
    own outcome — rather than stacking a third dispatch inside one When.

    What must NOT happen either way is MOVING the placement from one location to the
    other. That yields the same number of failures while silently un-grading the
    location it moved off, which looks like progress and is a coverage trade.

    Spec: security.mdx @ v3.1.1 :1462-1465, ``push_notification_config.authentication``
    named verbatim as a trigger; the pinned vector 027 registers exactly this shape.

    THE SHAPE IS AdCP's, and the plural ``schemes`` is not a typo. What this step writes
    goes into the AdCP request body on MCP and REST, where the pinned
    ``adcp.types.Authentication`` declares ``schemes: [<AuthenticationScheme>]``
    (``minItems``/``maxItems`` 1) under ``additionalProperties: false``. The singular
    ``scheme`` this used to write is the A2A PROTOBUF spelling
    (``a2a.types.a2a_pb2.AuthenticationInfo``), and sending it here made both transports
    refuse the request as ``INVALID_REQUEST`` at body validation — above the boundary, so
    the escalation never ran and the scenario graded a schema rejection while claiming to
    grade a signature refusal. The A2A translation to the singular spelling belongs to the
    transport (``tests.harness._base._a2a_task_push_notification_config``), not here.

    hide the second behind the first for exactly as long as the first stays broken.
