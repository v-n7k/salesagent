"""UC-005 storyboard: third-party format_id (foreign agent_url) is an observation, not a failure.

Scenario ``T-UC-005-storyboard-format-id-third-party-agent-out-of-scope``
(@third-party-agent): when a product advertises a ``format_id`` whose ``agent_url``
points at a creative agent OTHER than this seller, the seller cannot verify it
locally. Per the ``list_formats`` storyboard step such a reference is OUT OF
SCOPE — ``scope.equals=$agent_url`` with ``on_out_of_scope: warn`` — so the seller
MUST NOT fabricate a local format entry to cover it, and an empty result is an
observation, never a graded failure.

Wired to real production across a2a/mcp/rest (auto-parametrized; UC-005 →
CreativeFormatsEnv). Falsifiability comes from the COLLISION setup: the seller's own
catalog holds a format whose ``id`` matches the third-party reference but under the
SELLER's ``agent_url``. A filter comparing ``id`` alone would return that local
format as if it satisfied the third-party reference; the v3.1 ``(agent_url, id)``
federation filter (``format_id_identity``) returns nothing, which is the correct
observation. Both the production filter fix and the REST harness fix
(``build_rest_body`` now transmits ``format_ids``) are required for this to hold on
all three transports.
