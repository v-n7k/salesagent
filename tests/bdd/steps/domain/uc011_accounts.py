#: Sentinel for the omitted-key scenario: pass ``idempotency_key=OMIT_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY``
#: to send a sync_accounts payload carrying NO key at all.
#:
#: sync-accounts-request.json 3.1.1 lists idempotency_key in ``/required``, so "the seller
#: refuses a request without one" is an obligation that needs grading — and it cannot be
#: expressed by omitting the kwarg, because :func:`_sync_raw` defaults a key in for every
#: scenario that simply does not care about it. Same shape, same reason, as
#: ``tests.harness.media_buy_create.OMIT_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY`` and its ``OMIT_ACCOUNT`` sibling;
#: kept local because that one is the create env's and this is the sync verb's wire path.

def _sync_raw(ctx: dict, **payload: Any) -> None:
    """Dispatch a LITERAL sync_accounts payload — no ``SyncAccountsRequest`` first.

    THE NEGATIVE-PATH DISPATCH for the sync verb. Every caller expects the SELLER
    to reject the payload, so building the request model here would be fatal to
    the test's meaning: pydantic raises in the test process, the old ``except
    Exception: ctx["error"] = exc`` stashed a client-side exception, and
    production was never executed. Several of those step docstrings said so
    outright ("triggers Pydantic validation"). The scenario then graded the MODEL
    and said nothing about the SERVER — so nothing checked that the transports
    AGREE on a code.

    Goes through ``env.call_via`` (a raw kwargs bag IS a raw dispatch — see
    ``AccountSyncEnv.build_rest_body``'s explicit flat path) rather than
    ``dispatch_via_client``, because ``sync_accounts`` has NO pinned response
    model: the client seam resolves success through ``spec_response_model(tool)``
    and would hand back ``payload=None`` with ``is_success`` False, whereas the
    env's ``response_parser()`` hook types each verb correctly. That matters here
    precisely BECAUSE some of these rows are expected to graduate — if production
    accepts a payload the scenario thought invalid, this path reports a plain
    success instead of an unparseable one, so the graduation is legible rather
    than disguised as a failure.

    A CONFORMANT ``idempotency_key`` is defaulted in, because
    sync-accounts-request.json 3.1.1 lists it in ``/required`` and a buyer sends
    one on every request. Without it, a scenario grading an invalid ``operator``
    is rejected for the MISSING KEY first and the seller blames the wrong field —
    the scenario then reports a real disagreement about a field it never got to
    test. Every negative row here targets some OTHER field, so the key is
    setup, not subject.

    ``setdefault``, so a scenario that names its own key still grades that key:
    the malformed-key rows (T-UC-011-sync-idempotency-malformed) pass 15-character
    and bad-charset values through and must keep reaching the boundary with them.
    A scenario meaning to send NO key says so with :data:`OMIT_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY`,
    which is popped rather than defaulted — omission has to be STATED, because
    every scenario that simply does not care about the key looks identical to one
    that means to leave it out, and those must get the default.

    bag, and that is a genuine constraint rather than a preference:
    ``AccountListDispatchMixin.is_list_request`` selects the verb with
    ``isinstance(kwargs.get("req"), ListAccountsRequest)``. With no typed ``req``
    the discriminator returns False and a raw list payload would be MISROUTED to
    ``sync_accounts``. The client seam takes the tool name directly, so it is the
    only raw path that can address this verb.

    Safe on the success side too: ``list_accounts`` HAS a pinned response model

    (the single sanctioned surface, shared with then_error.py) plus the guarded
    ``wire_error_dict`` reader for the field pointer.

    What it replaces, and why the replacement is STRONGER rather than merely
    different: the previous assertions matched the scenario's field name as a
    SUBSTRING of ``str(error)``, or required ``isinstance(error, ValidationError)``.
    Both were satisfiable only while the request was built in the test process --
    the substring could land anywhere in a long pydantic message, and the
    isinstance check was literally asserting that production had NOT been reached.
    This reads ``errors[0].field``, the error.json pointer whose whole job is to
    name WHICH request member was rejected, at the position the spec defines it.

    INVALID_REQUEST, not VALIDATION_ERROR, and the distinction is the finding:
    the pinned ``sync-accounts-request`` declares ``accounts[]`` as an anyOf of
    two branches requiring ``['brand','operator','billing']`` (provisioning) or
    ``['account']`` (settings-update). An entry missing one of those satisfies

    required fields, or violates schema constraints" -- rather than the ACCOUNT
    being unprovisionable, which is what a per-account ``action: "failed"`` result
