"""D1 (#1291) — what we ADVERTISE is what we DO.

Core Invariant under test: *every signing field on the ``get_adcp_capabilities``
wire has exactly ONE source, and the side that ENFORCES it consumes the SAME
object.*

This module was written RED against a divergence nothing caught: a tenant holding an
ACTIVE signing key whose receiver registered no ``authentication`` got a real RFC 9421
signature on every AdCP webhook, while ``get_adcp_capabilities`` still answered
``webhook_signing: {supported: false}`` from two module literals
(``_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_UNSUPPORTED`` / ``_REQUEST_SIGNING_UNSUPPORTED``) on BOTH of its
construction sites. The wire said "receivers MUST NOT expect a Signature header" while
the socket carried one. security.mdx @ v3.1.1 :1404 scopes ``webhook_signing.supported``
to "any seller that emits webhooks" and reserves ``false`` for "the unsafe posture of
EMITTING UNSIGNED webhooks" — emitting SIGNED webhooks under a ``false`` declaration is
the mirror image of the over-promise the STRICT declaration policy was built to stop,
and is just as unverifiable for the receiver.

Both literals are gone. ``src.core.signing.posture.webhook_signing_posture`` is the one
producer of the block, ``_build_signing_blocks`` (``src/core/tools/capabilities.py``)
feeds BOTH construction sites from it, and
``src.core.signing.outbound.webhook_delivery_signer`` gates the socket on the same key
state. This module is what holds that shape: every assertion below is a regression pin
on "one object, two views", and every one of them is driven through a real surface
rather than through a builder.

**1. The outbound half** (``TestOutboundWebhookSigningHonesty``) — the leg the ticket's
acceptance box omitted. On the #1721 architecture there is no webhook sender factory and
no ``adcp.webhooks.WebhookSender``: the KEY decision is
``webhook_delivery_signer(tenant_id, repo, now)``, whose own docstring names D1 ("The
posture read here is the SAME object ``get_adcp_capabilities`` serializes"), and whose
``None`` return IS "deliver unsigned, honestly". So for ONE tenant and ONE receiver
registration the emitted ``webhook_signing.supported`` must EQUAL whether production
resolves a delivery signer at all — and both must equal the posture the tenant can
honestly hold, so a pair that agrees on the wrong answer still fails. That a receiver
which registered no ``authentication`` reaches the RFC 9421 arm with that signer (and
one that registered any ``authentication`` never does) is C1's claim, graded on the
surviving seam by ``tests/integration/test_webhook_signing_boundary.py``; it is cited
here, not re-derived, so there is one ``_headers_for`` probe in the suite and not two.

The publishability gate is graded in the same parametrization rather than in a
separate test, because it is the same claim on the other side of one boundary: a
keyed tenant on an origin that cannot serve https must advertise ``false`` AND stop
taking the RFC 9421 arm. Key discovery for our outbound signatures runs through
``identity.brand_json_url``, which the pin fixes to ``^https://`` and which
security.mdx rejects otherwise (``request_signature_brand_json_url_missing``), so
on such a host every signature we emit is one no conformant receiver can resolve a
key for. ``canonical_agent_url`` returns ``http://localhost:8080`` when a tenant has
neither ``virtual_host`` nor ``SALES_AGENT_DOMAIN`` — the default integration shape —
so the https rows set a DOTTED ``virtual_host`` and the gated row sets an explicitly
localhost one. Neither is decoration: with no ``virtual_host`` at all every row
would grade the gated branch while reading like it graded the declared one.

**2. The declared algorithm equals the emitted one**
(``TestDeclaredAlgorithmsEqualTheEmittedOne``). ``algorithms`` is the set we WILL
SIGN WITH (security.mdx @ v3.1.1 :1419), so the oracle is the ``alg=`` parameter on
a delivered ``Signature-Input``, parsed by the SDK's own parser — never
``SIGNING_ALG_VALUES``, which is the ALLOWED set. The sibling suite
(``test_webhook_signing_boundary.py``) already grades membership; what is ungraded
is EQUALITY with what we declare, which is what a receiver statically validates.

**3. The inbound half** (``TestInboundRequestSigningHonesty``). ``request_signing``
is behavioral: its buckets change what the verifier does. The advertised block and
the ``VerifierCapability`` B1 enforces must be two views of ONE object, so the test
derives both and asserts they agree. Every bucket this seller can declare reaches
``VerifierCapability``, which is what the undeclarable half bought: the projection is
no longer lossy, so there is no compensation left to keep visible.

**4. Both construction sites, one builder** (``TestBothConstructionSitesAgree``).
``request_signing.supported`` is an AGENT-level fact — the pin defines it as
"Whether this agent VERIFIES RFC 9421 signatures on incoming requests". There is no
verification middleware on this architecture: ``verify_inbound_signature`` runs inside
``_resolve_identity`` (``src/core/resolved_identity.py``), which every transport reaches
through ``_boundary.invoke_tool``, under the one kill switch
``SigningSettings.verifier_enabled`` (default True). It is NOT key-backed (it verifies
with the COUNTERPARTY's keys), so a keyless tenant and a caller with no resolved tenant
at all must both see it true, while ``webhook_signing`` stays false for exactly the
reason it is false: no key.

Everything is read back off the REST wire (``TransportResult.wire_response`` is the
HTTP JSON body), never off a typed payload — the claim is about what a buyer
receives. Only the outbound SOCKET is stubbed (``tests.helpers.webhook_wire``). The
tenant's key is minted through production (``provision_signing_key``), read back
through the production repository, and key presence is derived by production's
``signing_key_backed`` — never re-derived here.

          the whole reason the module exists.

        would take that arm; that the arm is selected by the ABSENCE of an
        ``authentication`` block is C1's claim and is graded against ``_headers_for``

        ``request_signing.supported`` is defined by the pin as "Whether this agent
        VERIFIES RFC 9421 signatures on incoming requests" — an AGENT-level fact.
        ``verify_inbound_signature`` runs inside ``_resolve_identity``, which every
        transport reaches ahead of any tenant read, and
        ``SigningSettings.verifier_enabled`` defaults True, so the agent genuinely
        does verify for a caller with no resolved tenant, and emitting ``false``

        opposite case and stays ``false``: with no tenant there is no key, so we
        genuinely do not sign. ``identity`` is absent for the same reason — there is
        no trust root to point at.

        The no-tenant caller is realized as ``credential={}`` — no headers at all, so
        neither ``x-adcp-tenant`` nor a bearer is presented and ``_detect_tenant``
        resolves nothing. That is the production shape of this branch;
        ``get_adcp_capabilities`` takes a ``PublicIdentity``, so the request is served
