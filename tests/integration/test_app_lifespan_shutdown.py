"""Integration regression tests for the FastAPI lifespan shutdown registry.

PR #1264 fix #3 wired the ``ProtocolWebhookService.close()`` (which releases a
long-lived ``requests.Session`` connection pool — real OS file descriptors)
into ``src.app.app_lifespan``'s shutdown phase. inverted the
dependency: the service self-registers ``close`` via
``src.core.lifecycle.register_shutdown`` at first construction, and
``app_lifespan`` only calls ``run_all_shutdown_callbacks()`` — it never names a
concrete service.

These are INTEGRATION tests: they drive the real ASGI lifespan protocol
(``asgi_lifespan.LifespanManager`` over ``FastAPI(lifespan=app_lifespan)``) and
exercise the genuine production ``app_lifespan`` — including the real
``_install_admin_mounts()`` startup hook — with a REAL
``ProtocolWebhookService`` instance registered through the REAL lifecycle
registry. They assert on the real ``requests.Session`` connection-pool state,
never on a mock.

No production symbol is patched. ``app_lifespan``'s startup legitimately
mutates the module-global ``src.app.app`` route table. The
``isolated_global_app_state`` fixture snapshots and restores that global, the
webhook-service singleton, AND the lifecycle shutdown-callback registry so
running the real startup/registration does not leak into sibling tests.

Mutation coverage (verified against real objects):
  (a) drop the ``await`` on ``run_all_shutdown_callbacks()``  -> pool not released -> FAIL
  (b) skip ``register_shutdown`` on construction              -> close never called -> FAIL
  (c) remove the per-callback try/except in the registry      -> close error escapes -> FAIL

The companion AST guard ``tests/unit/test_architecture_app_lifespan_lazy_import.py``
pins the service-agnostic contract so (b)-style regressions also fail fast.
