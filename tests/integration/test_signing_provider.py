"""Integration tests for signing-key provisioning and SigningProvider resolution.

TDD RED for salesagent-z6nr.8 (A2 — signing key lifecycle). Nothing here passes
until ``src/core/signing/{keys,provider,algorithms}.py``, the ``SigningKey``
model and its migration exist.

This file grades the KEY-MATERIAL half of A2's core invariant: that the key we
sign with, the key we publish, and the key material we hold can never silently
disagree. Concretely —

* Two overlapping active ``request-signing`` keys, distinguished only by ``kid``,
  BOTH resolve through production and BOTH produce signatures that verify against
  their own STORED ``public_jwk`` (and not against the other's). This is the one
  mechanism that serves both rotation overlap and the webhook blast-radius
  isolation security.mdx:955 describes ("isolation comes from the ``kid``").
  Resolution goes through ``_resolve_signing_provider(..., kid=...)`` — a test
  that hand-constructs ``InMemorySigningProvider`` grades nothing, and skips the
  tripwire it is supposed to be exercising.
* The private half never leaves the row: it is stored as the PKCS#8
  ``BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY`` PEM the SDK returned, under the deployment KEK,
  and provisioning refuses outright when no KEK is configured. Provisioning over
  a live ``kid`` fails rather than clobbering key material every counterparty
  already holds the public half of.
* The init tripwire (security.mdx:951) fires on a GENUINE mismatch and — the
  failure mode actually worth guarding — does NOT false-alarm on a healthy
  passphrase-encrypted PEM.

Note the SDK's provider contract: ``sign`` is ASYNC, and ``key_id()`` /
``algorithm()`` are METHODS. Attribute access yields a truthy bound method, which
is how ``<bound method ...>`` ends up in a ``keyid`` header.

class TestRevocationBeatsTheProviderCache:
    """A revoked key stops resolving IMMEDIATELY — inside the 60s cache window.

    The mechanism is ordering, not invalidation: ``_resolve_cached`` selects the row
    BEFORE it consults the cache, and ``_select_row`` refuses a revoked row on both
    paths (``active_at`` excludes it in SQL; the explicit-``kid`` path raises). So the
    cache is never reached for a revoked key.

    THIS TEST EXISTS BECAUSE PRODUCTION SAID OTHERWISE. The admin revoke route claimed
    the cache bust "is not optional… a revoke that skips it keeps signing with the
    retired key for up to a minute". That was false, and nothing graded either claim —
    two comments in the same tree disagreed about whether a 60-second window existed.

    IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CALL ``clear_signing_provider_cache()``. Clearing first
    would make this pass for the wrong reason: it would prove the cache can be emptied,
    not that revocation beats it. The key is resolved FIRST so the entry is genuinely
    cached and unexpired, then revoked, then resolved again — all well inside
    ``_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`` and with no clock manipulation, so a pass cannot be explained
    by expiry.

    MUTATION: drop ``SigningKey.revoked_at.is_(None)`` from
    :meth:`SigningKeyRepository.active_at` and this goes RED — the revoked row is selected
    again and resolves from the warm entry, which is the 60-second window the route's
    comment imagined.

    NOT the mutation you would reach for first, and the reason is worth keeping: reversing
    the ORDER in ``_resolve_cached`` (cache before row) does NOT falsify this test, because
    the cache key is ``(tenant_id, row.kid)`` — you must read the row to know the key. On
    the ``active_at`` path the ordering is therefore FORCED, not chosen, so the property
    rests on the row filter rather than on statement order. A mutation aimed at the order
    passes and proves nothing; that was measured, not assumed.
