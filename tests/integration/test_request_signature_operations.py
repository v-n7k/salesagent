"""The operation a request is graded AS, and the rule that outranks its bucket.

WHAT #1721 DID TO THIS FILE'S SUBJECT
-------------------------------------
Pre-merge, the verifier was an ASGI middleware ABOVE authentication and above transport
dispatch, so it had to NAME the operation itself: sniff an anonymous body, reconcile four
transport-local name registries, and promote whatever it could not name.
``src/core/signing/operations.py`` was that resolver, and most of this module graded it.

It does not exist. On #1721 the verifier runs inside ``_resolve_identity``, which
``invoke_tool`` reaches only AFTER ``TOOLS[tool_name]`` resolved, and the name it grades is
the registry key the transport dispatched on
(``SignatureSubject(operation=tool_name, ...)``, ``src/core/tools/_boundary.py``). The
operation IS the registry key, on every transport, by construction. So:

* "the same logical call carries the same name on every surface" is no longer a
  reconciliation to grade — MCP registration, the A2A agent card and the ``/api/v1`` router
  are all GENERATED from ``TOOLS`` — and it is observed end to end, on all three legs, by
  ``tests/integration/test_harness_signed_dispatch.py``;
* the namespace split is not a rule any more: the ``protocol_methods_*`` buckets are
  UNDECLARABLE (``docs/design/request-signing-subset.md``), so there is no second namespace
  a name could be coerced into and nothing to reject at config time;
* "an anonymous body cannot mint a Prometheus series with ``params.name``" is
  unrepresentable: a name no registry serves never reaches the boundary at all. The bound is
  graded structurally by
  ``tests/unit/test_architecture_signing_operations.py::TestTheOperationLabelIsBoundedByADerivedSet``;
* "an unsigned body survives the buffer" is graded on the capture itself by
  ``tests/unit/test_signed_exchange_capture.py`` — lossless replay, over-cap flagged and
  still replayed, non-AdCP paths untouched. Nothing rewrites a request body between the
  signer and the capture any more (``src/routes/rest_compat_middleware.py`` is deleted);
* "a session frame is not an unresolvable request" has no subject left. There is no
  promote-what-you-cannot-name rule to bypass, because a frame that names no registry row
  never reaches a verifier: a bodiless ``GET /mcp`` and an unparseable POST are answered by
  the transport, above the boundary.

WHAT SURVIVES, AND WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT IN A UNIT TEST
--------------------------------------------------------
Three obligations whose subject is the WIRE, and which no unit call on
``verify_inbound_signature`` can state, because each turns on something only a real request
carries — the route the verb and path resolved to, the VALIDATED request the escalation is
read off, or the byte count the capture measured:

1. **The verb is part of the operation's identity.** ``POST /api/v1/media-buys`` is
   ``create_media_buy`` and ``PUT /api/v1/media-buys/{id}`` is ``update_media_buy``. A
   declaration naming one must not grade the other.
2. **Webhook credentials outrank the bucket** (security.mdx @ v3.1.1 :1462-1465, restated at
   :1375 as firing "regardless of ``required_for`` membership"), and BOTH triggers do. Only
   ``push_notification_config.authentication`` has a compliance vector, so a reader handling
   it alone passes all 40 and is still wrong; the ``accounts[].notification_configs[]``
   trigger is the one graded here.
3. **A signed body too large to hash** is refused where the seller verifies and served where
   it does not.

Every rejection has a control that must NOT be rejected under a declaration differing in ONE
variable, and every acceptance is paired with a POSITIVE observable
(:func:`_assert_verifier_looked`) — an absence of rejection is byte-identical to a verifier
that never ran.

THE ORACLE IS THE CHALLENGE, NEVER THE STATUS. ``rejection_code`` reads
``WWW-Authenticate: Signature error="<code>"`` off the response (``AuthChallengeResponder``,
``src/core/auth_middleware.py``, writes it from the code on the finished body). A bare 401 is
equally produced by the bearer refusal one step earlier, and a "not 200" oracle is satisfied
by the application refusing the same request for an entirely different reason.

TWO THINGS THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DRIVE, stated rather than silently dropped:

* an ANONYMOUS unsigned call to a PROTECTED row. ``_resolve_identity`` step 2 answers
  ``AUTH_MISSING`` before the verifier is reached, which is correct — nothing was presented —
  so the anonymous half of the composition rule is graded on the PUBLIC rows below and, for
  the rest, by ``tests/unit/test_request_signature_composition_rule.py``;
* the FIRST escalation trigger unsigned. It is already driven through a validated request by
  ``tests/integration/test_credential_block_is_logged.py``.

    Which requests those are is exactly what the two halves of ``none`` disagree about, and
    the disagreement is on the WIRE:

    * ``supported: true`` narrowed to other operations — the seller verifies, so a signed body
      it cannot digest is refused rather than silently admitted unverified;
    * ``supported: false`` — the seller advertises that it verifies nothing, so it must not
      start refusing signed traffic it has never inspected. Its 200 is the CONTROL, and it is
      what pins the intra-method ORDER: an over-cap check hoisted ahead of the ``supported``
      gate would refuse this row too, taking a conformant pass-through away from every seller
      that never opted in.

    THE REFUSAL IS A 401 WITH A CODE, not the pre-merge branch's bodyless 413. The verifier no
    longer sends a response of its own: it raises ``AdCPRequestSignatureError`` inside
    ``_resolve_identity`` and ``AuthChallengeResponder`` renders the code, so the graded byte
    is ``request_signature_header_malformed`` at step 1 — the pre-check, refused in every
    bucket.

    ``tests/unit/test_signed_exchange_capture.py::test_an_over_cap_body_is_flagged_and_still_replayed``
