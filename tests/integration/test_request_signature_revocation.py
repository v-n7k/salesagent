"""Integration tests pinning salesagent-z6nr.11 (#1291 A5) — checklist STEP 9,
revocation, decided by exactly one callable handed to
``VerifyOptions.revocation_checker``.

Each test below encodes the behavior the REFINED plan creates
(``bd show salesagent-z6nr.11`` → "## Refinement (atom salesagent-srpm.20,
post-review)"). The refinement AMENDS the original Implementation Plan and wins
wherever the two differ.

:func:`src.core.signing.verifier.verify_inbound_signature` is called from
``_resolve_identity``, which the boundary runs under ``asyncio.to_thread``
(``src/core/tools/_boundary.py``). The defects this module grades turn on one
property of that path: its only catch is ``_verify_signed``'s
``except SignatureVerificationError``, and the SDK raises bare ``Exception``
subclasses through it.

Spec grounding (reproducible):
``git -C ~/projects/adcp show v3.1.1:docs/building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx``
— :1238 (step 9: membership then staleness), :1328 (one combined list at the
brand.json origin), :1333 (fetch-failure safe default, grace = 4x the previous
polling interval), :1686-1689 (the stale-then-membership pseudo-code).
Compliance vector ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/test-vectors/request-signing/
negative/017-key-revoked.json`` is graded at the WIRE by B3
(``salesagent-z6nr.14``); nothing here re-grades its corpus.

What is graded here, and why each one exists
--------------------------------------------

**The three that would otherwise be production incidents.** Wiring a bare
``CachingRevocationChecker`` into ``_run_verifier`` turns three ordinary
conditions into 500s, because the SDK raises plain ``Exception`` subclasses on
a path whose only catch is ``except SignatureVerificationError``
(``verifier.py:388``):

1. *A stale list* — ``RevocationListFreshnessError`` (``revocation_fetcher.py:122``)
   escapes ``verifier.py:294`` untranslated. The graded answer is a 401 carrying
   ``request_signature_revocation_stale``; the SDK docstring at :600-602 claims
   the verifier maps it and the verifier does not.
   :class:`TestStaleRevocationList`.
2. *An unresolvable (or blocked) revocation host* — R-H1. ``default_revocation_list_fetcher``
   calls ``build_ip_pinned_transport`` OUTSIDE its ``except httpx.HTTPError``
   (``revocation_fetcher.py:262``) and that raises ``SSRFValidationError``
   — a bare ``Exception`` (``ip_pinned_transport.py:78-79`` turns
   ``OSError``/gaierror into it) — which neither ``_ensure_fresh``'s warm path
   (``except (RevocationListFetchError, RevocationListParseError)``, :800) nor
   its cold path (no ``except`` at all) catches. A transient DNS failure on one
   counterparty's revocation endpoint would take down every signed request from
   that counterparty. :class:`TestRevocationHostThatCannotBeDialed`.
3. *A counterparty that publishes no list at all* — the COLD path.
   ``_ensure_fresh:779-781`` calls ``_refresh`` with no ``except`` when
   ``_current_list is None``. Nobody in the ecosystem publishes a list today, so
   this is the DEFAULT case, not an edge case. :class:`TestAbsentRevocationList`.

**R-M3 — the static set is consulted FIRST.** The spec contradicts itself here
(:1238 lists membership first, the pseudo-code at :1686-1689 checks staleness
first) and no vector grades the combination. Under fetched-first a deployment
that ever set ``require_revocation_list=True`` would answer
``request_signature_revocation_stale`` for the seeded ``test-revoked-2026``,
turning vector 017 into a graded FAIL caused by an unrelated config flag.
:class:`TestStaticSetIsConsultedFirst` pins the ORDERING, not just the outcome:
the wire code discriminates the two orderings, and the unavailable-metric
proves the fetched checker was never consulted at all.

**F7 — the ordering canary.** Vector 017's ``$comment`` says its ``Signature``
bytes are "a placeholder copied from positive/001 and do not verify
cryptographically", and that a crypto-first verifier answers
``request_signature_invalid`` which graders should surface as a step-ordering
bug. Revoked keyid + deliberately corrupt signature must still answer
``request_signature_key_revoked`` (step 9 at ``verifier.py:294``, before crypto
verify at :311). Cheap, permanent. :class:`TestRevokedKeyidRejects`.

**R-M1 — no permanent JWKS snapshot.** Keying the registry on issuer origin
while constructing with ``StaticJwksResolver(resolution.jwks)`` breaks two ways,
both flowing from :1328's ONE-combined-list-per-operator-origin model: an
operator rotating its list-signing key breaks revocation for that origin until
process restart (the snapshot never refreshes even though ``AgentResolution``
re-resolves every ``agent_resolution_ttl_seconds``), and two counterparties
sharing an operator origin 401 each other. :class:`TestResolverReadsThroughTheResolutionCache`.

**R-M2 — no cross-counterparty head-of-line blocking.** ``_run_verifier`` runs
under ``asyncio.to_thread`` (``src/core/tools/_boundary.py:333``), which is
the thread-pool case ``revocation_fetcher.py:609-618`` says needs an external
lock — but a module-level lock held around ``__call__`` spans the 10s-default
HTTPS fetch inside ``_ensure_fresh``, so one dead counterparty stalls every
signed request in the process. :class:`TestNoCrossCounterpartyBlocking`.

**R-L — grace multiplier 4.0.** ``DEFAULT_GRACE_MULTIPLIER`` is 2.0
(``revocation_fetcher.py:71``); security.mdx :1333 requires 4x. Asserted on a
``checker_for``-BUILT entry, never an injected one: injecting bypasses the
single place the argument is passed, so a reverted argument would silently
halve outage tolerance with every test still green.
:class:`TestCheckerForBuildsTheSpecCompliantChecker`.

Why these tests are not vacuous
-------------------------------

Every wire test runs the REAL SDK checklist over a REAL Ed25519 signature and
observes the REAL 401/200 plus ``WWW-Authenticate``; the bucket is pinned to
``supported`` in every case, because a request in the narrowed ``none`` bucket
reaches no checklist and would grade nothing (R8). The
only thing ever substituted is the HTTP fetch of the counterparty's list —
through the SDK's own documented ``fetcher=`` seam on a real
``CachingRevocationChecker``, or not at all (the SSRF tests dial for real).

The contract this suite grades
------------------------------

``src.core.config.SigningSettings`` (``get_settings().signing``, which is what
``verify_inbound_signature`` reads per request — the pre-merge ``SigningConfig``
is gone)
  ``revoked_keyids: str``            comma-separated, ``revoked_keyid_list`` property
  ``require_revocation_list: bool``  default False (R1 posture flag)
  ``revocation_grace_multiplier: float``  default 4.0
  (``revocation_issuer_origin`` is in the plan but no test pins it here.)

``src.core.signing.revocation``
  ``CounterpartyRevocationChecker(*, static_revoked, fetched, require_list)``
      the ONE translation site; implements the SDK ``RevocationChecker``
      Protocol (``__call__(keyid) -> bool``)
  ``checker_for(resolution, config) -> CounterpartyRevocationChecker``
      the ONE construction site — the only place ``grace_multiplier`` is passed
  ``REVOCATION_CHECKER_CACHE: dict[str, CachingRevocationChecker]``
      process-level registry keyed by the ``scheme://netloc`` origin derived
      from ``AgentResolution.brand_json_url``, holding the SDK checker itself
      (plan step 2). A checker already present for an origin is REUSED as-is —
      which is also what R3 requires, since constructing per request would
      hammer the counterparty's endpoint. Any per-checker lock must therefore be
      obtained by origin with ``setdefault`` semantics, so an entry that appears
      without a paired lock (a test seeding one, or a concurrent builder) is
      still usable.

``src.core.signing.verifier``
  ``checker_for``                    imported into the verifier namespace and
                                     passed as ``VerifyOptions.revocation_checker``
                                     in ``_run_verifier`` (plan step 3). It is
                                     built in ``_verifier_dependencies``, so the
                                     wiring is exercised by every wire test here.

``src.core.metrics``
  ``adcp_request_revocation_unavailable_total``  incremented on the R1
      fail-open path. These tests assert the FAMILY TOTAL and deliberately not
      the label set: the review's cardinality finding (``issuer`` is
      counterparty-supplied and unbounded, vs a bounded ``reason``) was not
      settled by the refinement, and pinning a label here would prejudge it.

Covers: salesagent-z6nr.11 (Core Invariant + Refinement R-H1, R-M1, R-M2,
R-M3, R-L, and F7's ordering canary).

        ``DEFAULT_GRACE_MULTIPLIER`` is 2.0 (``revocation_fetcher.py:71``), so
        the 4x is ours to pass and ours to keep. Asserted on a

        this module carries a multiplier the TEST chose: a reverted or forgotten
        argument would silently halve every deployment's outage tolerance with
        the rest of this file still green.

        The arithmetic in :721 confirms 4x is exact rather than a rounding —
        ceiling 30 min → 30 + 4x30 = 150 min ("~2.5 h of tolerance"), floor
        1 min → 1 + 4x1 = 5 min ("~5 min").
