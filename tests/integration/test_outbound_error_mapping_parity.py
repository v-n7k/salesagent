"""RED grader for salesagent-tbrk.4: one classifier, both seams agree (salesagent-16bhn.25).

``src/core/helpers/outbound_error_mapping.py`` housed ``raise_mapped_outbound_error``
(the raw ``send``/``asend`` seam) and the now-deleted ``mcp_seam_error_mapping.py``
housed ``raise_mapped_mcp_error`` (the guarded MCP seam) — each hand-wrote the SAME
status -> AdCP-class table, with drifting spellings (#1802's F2 finding).
tbrk.4 collapses both onto one ``adcp_error_for_status(status, *, retry_after,
provenance)`` classifier and, as part of that, retires ``raise_mapped_mcp_error``'s
``agent_label: str`` parameter in favour of the same ``provenance:
UrlProvenance`` union ``raise_mapped_outbound_error`` already takes (Epic B,
salesagent-6gpt.1) — D2 is binding: "the classifier takes the union, and
agent_label: str retires with Epic B's raise_mapped_outbound_error rewrite."

This file drives the SAME simulated origin behavior through BOTH seams and
asserts the two-layer wire envelope they each produce is identical where the
plan says it must be:

* a 429 with ``Retry-After: 7`` -> ``RATE_LIMITED`` with the same clamped
  ``retry_after`` on both;
* a 418 (a terminal 4xx neither seam retries) -> the same terminal class
  (``AdCPConfigurationError``) and wire code (``CONFIGURATION_ERROR``) on both;
* a 503, retried to exhaustion, on the OUTBOUND path only -> ``attempts`` and
  ``last_status`` survive onto the buyer-visible envelope ``details`` (the
  outbound seam's richer failure object; the MCP seam has no ``attempts`` to
  preserve — J3/J2 in tbrk.4's design record that asymmetry as inherent, not a
  bug this table grades away).

RED today, for the right reason: the first two classes call
``raise_mapped_mcp_error(..., provenance=..., logger=...)`` — the SIGNATURE
tbrk.4 will land — against the function's CURRENT signature,
``raise_mapped_mcp_error(exc, *, agent_label: str, logger)``. That is a
``TypeError`` raised from inside the test body (not a collection error): it is
exactly AC4 ("no ``agent_label: str`` parameter survives on any mapper entry
point") failing to hold, which is the behavior this lane exists to build. The
503-exhaustion class exercises ONLY the outbound path (already provenance-typed
today, per tbrk.4's verified starting state) and is expected to already pass —
it pins the attempts/last_status preservation (AC6) that must survive the
refactor unchanged (J3), not new behavior.

Spec grounding (AdCP 3.1.1, ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/enums/error-code.json``
``enumMetadata`` — the authority, not ``STANDARD_ERROR_CODES``): ``RATE_LIMITED``
is ``transient`` (retry after ``retry_after``); ``CONFIGURATION_ERROR`` is
``terminal`` ("surface to a human at the seller ... MUST NOT auto-retry");
``SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`` is ``transient``. Graded (error-code emission).
Conformance storyboard: ungraded — this is an internal mapper-parity
obligation, not a wire contract any ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/`` scenario
exercises (same finding as the sibling files this test borrows its shape
from, ``test_operator_agent_mcp_seam_egress.py`` / ``test_url_provenance_wire.py``).
