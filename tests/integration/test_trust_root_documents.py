"""Integration tests for the trust root this agent publishes (#1291 A3, salesagent-z6nr.9).

Grades four production surfaces together: ``src/core/agent_identity.py``,
``src/core/signing/trust_root.py``, ``src/routes/well_known.py`` and
``SigningKeyRepository.publishable_at``.

Core Invariant under test: ONE canonical agent URL string per tenant, computed by
exactly one function, is the sole identity from which every trust-root document
and every published key origin is derived — so the byte-equal ``agents[].url``
match a verifier performs, the eTLD+1 origin binding, and the ``key_origins``
consistency check can never disagree with each other or with where our keys
actually resolve.

What each group grades, and why it is written the way it is:

* **Per-endpoint entries (R-H1).** security.mdx:1104 step 5 byte-equals the URL
  whose ``get_adcp_capabilities`` the counterparty invoked — and that is an
  ENDPOINT (``/mcp``, ``/a2a``), never a bare origin. The brand.json schema's own
  ``#/definitions/agents`` description blesses several same-type entries with
  distinct urls. The expected literals are therefore discovered by ASKING THE
  RUNNING APP which path it actually serves, never by rebuilding the string with
  the same helper production uses: a trailing-slash mismatch is the spec's own
  worked failure example (``https://x.com/mcp`` vs ``https://x.com/mcp/``), and
  Starlette's ``/mcp`` mount redirects while ``/a2a`` does not. A test that
  constructs its expectation the way the code does proves nothing.

* **``revoked_at`` on the JWKS, not only on adagents (R-H3).** Per F1 the JWKS is
  authoritative for REQUEST signing; the adagents pin governs sell-side webhooks
  only. The schema's justification for the grace window is that caches which have
  not refreshed "still find the key and can evaluate the revocation marker" — a
  JWKS entry without the marker is indistinguishable from a live key, which
  inverts the property the window exists for.

* **``publishable_at`` filters ``purpose``, and ``revoked_at`` is the only exit
  (R-M4).** ``not_after`` un-publishes a key whose signatures are still inside
  their verification window; ``not_before`` un-publishes a key that rotation must
  publish BEFORE it starts signing. Purpose is filtered because security.mdx:1079
  forbids co-tenanting governance keys with request-signing keys.

* **Grace EXCEEDS the published cache TTL (R-M2/R-L).** Equal values leave zero
  margin for an intermediary adding delay, so the relationship is asserted (2x,
  from one constant) rather than two magic numbers.

Schema authority: the vendored v3.1.1 fixtures under
``tests/fixtures/adcp_schemas_pinned/3.1.1/`` (``adagents.json`` and
``brand.json`` DIFFER at the older ``PINNED_SHA``, and
``core/authorized-agent-base.json`` — where ``signing_keys[]`` lives — does not
exist there at all). The adagents document additionally goes through
``adcp.adagents.validate_adagents_structure``: that is the exact code path our
OWN consumers run (``src/admin/blueprints/publisher_partners.py``), so it grades
the producer against the consumer rather than against a second opinion.

No BDD feature accompanies this work. Not because the harness cannot model these
documents — it models them as COUNTERPARTY state today (``BR-UC-020:721`` serves
a ``/.well-known/brand.json``; ``BR-UC-025:135`` a publisher's adagents.json) —
but because A3 emits no TOOL RESPONSE for the four-transport dispatch to grade.
The Core Invariant is tool-gradable where ``get_adcp_capabilities`` emits
``identity.brand_json_url`` (#1291 D1, salesagent-z6nr.20) — the block this trust
root backs, and the reason ``identity`` no longer sits in ``_UNBACKED_BLOCKS``.
That emission is graded where the capabilities document is
(``_resolve_signing_blocks``); this file grades the publication side it points at,
so the two halves of the pair cannot be believed on each other's evidence.
