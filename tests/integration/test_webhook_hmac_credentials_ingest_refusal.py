"""create_media_buy refuses an HMAC-SHA256 webhook registration that carries no secret.

A buyer who registers ``push_notification_config.authentication.schemes =
["HMAC-SHA256"]`` and supplies no ``credentials`` has asked for a webhook we
cannot produce. Today that registration is ACCEPTED: ``_create_media_buy_impl``
maps ``schemes[0]`` → ``authentication_type`` and ``credentials`` →
``authentication_token`` and persists the row with a null token
(``src/core/tools/media_buy_create.py`` push-config persistence block), the
create returns success, and the defect only surfaces later — inside a
background sender, where no request is left to refuse into and the buyer's only
possible signal is a log line nobody reads.

Spec grounding — AdCP 3.1.1, the version this repo PINS (``adcp==6.6.0``,
``docs/adcp-spec-version.md``):

1. ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/core/push-notification-config.json`` →
   ``Authentication``: ``required: ["schemes", "credentials"]``, and
   ``credentials`` carries ``minLength: 32`` — "For HMAC-SHA256: shared secret
   used to generate signature." Read off the pinned SDK's generated model
   (``adcp.types.PushNotificationConfig.model_json_schema()``). A registration
   naming the scheme with no credentials is not an under-specified request; it
   is an INVALID document by the pinned schema.
2. Same file, ``authentication`` description: "**Precedence is a switch, not a
   fallback:** presence of this block selects the legacy scheme; absence
   selects 9421. A seller MUST NOT sign the same webhook both ways". So there
   is no legal salvage: we cannot sign (no secret), and we cannot quietly fall
   back to the RFC 9421 profile, because the block's PRESENCE already selected
   legacy. The registration is unservable and the only honest answer is to
   refuse it while the buyer is still on the phone.
3. ``enums/error-code.json`` ``enumDescriptions`` settles the CODE, and the
   two members are defined against each other:

     INVALID_REQUEST  — "Request is malformed, missing required fields, or
                         violates schema constraints."
     VALIDATION_ERROR — "Request contains invalid field values or violates
                         business rules beyond schema validation."

   Point 1 already established that this document violates the pinned schema:
   ``credentials`` is REQUIRED and carries ``minLength: 32``. "Missing required
   fields" and "violates schema constraints" are the literal words, so the code
   is ``INVALID_REQUEST``. ``enumMetadata`` gives BOTH members
   ``recovery: "correctable"``, so recovery cannot discriminate them; the buyer
   is still the only party who can supply the secret, and supplying it makes the
   identical request succeed, so ``correctable`` is right for the reason it was
   always right.

The spec does not say a seller MUST refuse such a registration — that half is
genuinely silent, and the conformance storyboard grades no such step (see
below). But it is NOT silent on which code a refusal carries, because the
refused document violates a schema constraint and ``error-code.json`` assigns
that case by name. This module previously reasoned from the silence to the
sibling gate one field over — ``reject_unsafe_webhook_registration_url``
(``src/core/webhook_validator.py``) → ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` — and so copied a
code for a question the pin had already answered. The sibling keeps
``VALIDATION_ERROR`` correctly: a deny-listed host is a SCHEMA-VALID
``format: "uri"`` string refused by seller policy, which is "business rules
beyond schema validation". Same envelope shape, different halves of one
sentence pair.

Production already encodes exactly this split, and emits ``INVALID_REQUEST``
here because it is right to: ``src/core/exceptions.py:1266-1281`` maps a pydantic
``ValidationError`` ("BY CONSTRUCTION a schema-constraint violation") to
``AdCPInvalidRequestError``, and leaves a plain ``ValueError`` from business
logic on ``AdCPValidationError``. Every surface graded here refuses through the
pinned request model.

Asserted from ``tests/helpers/webhook_credential_refusal.py``, which owns this
contract for the protocol AND admin surfaces so they cannot drift from it.

Conformance storyboard: UNGRADED — nothing in ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/`` grades
a seller refusing an unservable webhook registration (same finding recorded for
the sibling URL refusal, ``test_webhook_url_ingest_refusal.py``).

Transport coverage is deliberately asymmetric, because the surfaces differ:

* REST (``CreateMediaBuyBody.push_notification_config: dict[str, Any]``) and
  A2A (the create skill forwards the raw dict — ``create_media_buy_raw``
  ``model_dump``s only when it is already a ``PushNotificationConfig``) accept
  the invalid document and hand it to ``_impl`` untouched. These are the
  surfaces the gate exists for.
* MCP types the parameter as ``adcp.PushNotificationConfig``, so FastMCP's
  TypeAdapter rejects the document one layer earlier, on
  ``authentication.credentials`` being required. Same buyer outcome, different
  mechanism — graded separately below so nobody "simplifies" that annotation to
  ``dict`` and silently opens a third hole.

Buyer-visible change (named here as well as in the PR, not smuggled): a
create_media_buy that TODAY succeeds with ``schemes: ["HMAC-SHA256"]`` and no
credentials starts failing with a correctable INVALID_REQUEST. That is the
intent.

    The ``push_notification_config.`` prefix USED to diverge here: this layer

    ``create_media_buy``'s MCP signature annotates the parameter as
    ``adcp.PushNotificationConfig``, whose ``Authentication`` model requires
    ``credentials``. So this document never reaches ``_impl`` on MCP at all and
    the buyer is refused by FastMCP's TypeAdapter. That is the right OUTCOME by
    a different MECHANISM, which is exactly why it is pinned separately: relax
    the annotation to ``dict`` for "forward compatibility" and this transport
    silently joins the untyped ones.

    Deliberately NOT asserting the credentials field path here — the refusal
    comes from schema validation, not from the gate, and demanding the gate's
    envelope would be demanding that the typed wrapper stop typing.
