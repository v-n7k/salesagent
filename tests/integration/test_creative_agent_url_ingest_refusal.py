"""Ingest-time egress refusal of the buyer-supplied ``creatives[].format_id.agent_url``.

``sync_creatives`` lets the buyer name the creative agent their creative's
format lives on: ``creatives[].format_id.agent_url`` is read straight off the
request (``src/core/tools/creatives/_validation.py``) and dialled — through
``fetch_format_spec`` → ``CreativeAgentRegistry`` → ``call_mcp_tool`` — to
check the format exists. That makes it a buyer-supplied URL WE fetch, i.e. an
SSRF vector in the same class as ``property_list.agent_url`` on
``get_products`` (salesagent-nbbe, exemplar
``tests/integration/test_property_list_resolver.py``
``TestRefusedBuyerUrlOnTheWire``) — and it is reachable by any authenticated
advertiser, the lowest privilege bar of any egress path in the tree
(gh-#1790).

The connection itself is already refused: ``call_mcp_tool`` runs
``validate_url`` before its candidate loop. What this file grades is the half
that is NOT closed — WHOSE error the refusal is reported as. The registry
translates a seam refusal through ``raise_mapped_outbound_error``, whose
documented branch is the OPERATOR one: an agent endpoint that is registered tenant
configuration becomes ``CONFIGURATION_ERROR`` / terminal, "surface to a human
at the seller — the buyer cannot resolve a seller-side deployment
misconfiguration". That classification is correct for the registry's normal
caller and wrong here, because on this path the URL came out of the buyer's own
request document: the buyer is told a seller is misconfigured, is told not to
retry, and is given no ``field`` naming the input that was actually refused.

Provenance, not module, decides the classification —
``src/core/helpers/outbound_error_mapping.py`` says so in its own docstring
("The opposite case — a buyer-supplied URL — keeps the seam's own
AdCPBlockedUrlError (VALIDATION_ERROR) and names the offending field instead")
— and this path is the buyer branch it names.

Spec grounding — AdCP 3.1.1, the version this repo PINS (``adcp==6.6.0``,
``docs/adcp-spec-version.md``; prose via ``git -C <adcp-checkout> show
v3.1.1:<path>``):

1. ``docs/building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx`` § "Webhook URL validation
   (SSRF)": "Any URL that a buyer, seller, or governance agent provides for
   another party to fetch is an SSRF vector." Point 1 (reject non-HTTPS),
   point 2 (reject reserved-range addresses, ``169.254.169.254`` named
   outright), point 6 (disclose nothing about our network — which leaves
   ``error.field`` as the only channel naming WHICH input to fix).
2. ``docs/building/by-layer/L3/error-handling.mdx`` § "Recovery
   Classification" (§ "Request Validation" is a five-row table that lists
   ``INVALID_REQUEST``, not ``VALIDATION_ERROR``): egress policy refuses this
   URL identically forever, so ``terminal`` addressed to the SELLER strands a
   buyer who could fix it by sending a different ``agent_url``.
   ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` and ``CONFIGURATION_ERROR`` are both in the pinned
   ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/enums/error-code.json``; the enumMetadata
   recovery/suggestion pair quoted above is what makes them non-interchangeable.
   VALIDATION_ERROR rather than the sibling INVALID_REQUEST because that enum
   defines the two apart, verbatim: INVALID_REQUEST = "Request is malformed,
   missing required fields, or violates schema constraints"; VALIDATION_ERROR =
   "Request contains invalid field values or violates business rules beyond
   schema validation" — a ``format: "uri"``-valid URL in a blocked range is the
   latter. Both are correctable, so the buyer's retry
   behaviour is identical either way.
3. ``format_id`` is a property of ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/core/creative-asset.json``
   (``$ref`` ``core/format-id.json``, "Always a structured object
   {agent_url, id}"), and ``creatives`` is a top-level array on
   ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/creative/sync-creatives-request.json`` — hence the
   JSONPath-lite path ``creatives[].format_id.agent_url``.

Conformance storyboard: UNGRADED — nothing in ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/``
grades a seller refusing a counterparty-supplied URL (same finding recorded for
salesagent-nbbe and for the webhook ingest twin).
