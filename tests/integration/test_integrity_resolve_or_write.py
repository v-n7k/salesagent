"""Two properties of ``resolve_or_write`` that no call site can grade.

**Losing the race must discard the failed write and NOTHING else.** The recovery
runs inside ``session.begin_nested()``, and that choice is invisible at most call
sites: a handler staging only the contested row answers identically whether the
recovery rolls back to a SAVEPOINT or rolls back the whole session. The
difference only shows where the same transaction already carries other work —
the self-service signup shape, where the tenant, its adapter config and its
currency limit are staged before the admin user is inserted, and a session-wide
rollback destroys all three (measured) before the handler adds a default
principal carrying a foreign key to the tenant it just lost.

That shape cannot be raced through the signup route itself: the route mints a
fresh tenant inside its own uncommitted transaction, so no independent writer
can reference it — the winning ``User`` insert would fail the foreign key before
it could ever collide. The other site with earlier staged work, the settings
virtual-host update, returns its answer before committing, so survival is
unobservable there. So it is graded here, in the shape production has: earlier
work staged in the transaction, then a contested write that loses.

**An unrelated constraint violation must keep its own story.** The narrowing is
only observable when the re-resolve WOULD find a winner — otherwise the
"claim no cause we cannot attribute" branch re-raises and an unnarrowed handler
looks correct. That combination (a resolvable conflict plus a failure caused by
a DIFFERENT constraint) cannot be staged through a route, where the two are the
same statement. Here the write violates the ``role`` CHECK while a resolvable
row exists, so an unnarrowed recovery reports a bad role as "already exists" —
which is exactly how a real data defect disappears behind a plausible story
about concurrency.
