"""The brand_id repair migration un-mangles poisoned rows, and refuses ambiguity.

Covers alembic revision f4d31a97c058 (salesagent-wkfu).

``BrandId`` is a ``RootModel[str]`` with no ``__str__`` override, so
``str(brand.brand_id)`` yields the repr ``root='brand_one'``. salesagent-myhs
fixed the write path; every row already written before that fix still carries
the repr in ``accounts.brand->>'brand_id'`` — and, because the sync create path
always GENERATES the name, in ``accounts.name`` as well
(``acme.com:root='brand_one' c/o example.com``).

Such a row is not merely wrong, it is unreadable: ``Account.brand`` is
``JSONType(model=BrandReference)``, which validates on READ, and ``BrandId``'s
pattern is ``^[a-z0-9_]+$``. So the load-bearing assertion in this module is
that the repaired row materialises through the ORM at all — a check on
``brand->>'brand_id'`` alone would pass over a partial repair that left the row
just as unloadable.

This module is the migration's ONLY grading. The integration suite builds its
schema with ``Base.metadata.create_all``, so nothing else in the suite executes
a migration's SQL; without a migration test the repair is completely ungraded.

The refusal branches matter as much as the happy one. The Core Invariant is that an
automated repair may rewrite only a provably-mangled representation of a value
the buyer already submitted: it may never choose between two accounts, never
guess at an unrecognised shape, and never silently skip one. Since migrations
run automatically on startup and ``scripts/ops/migrate.py`` exits non-zero on
failure, each refusal is a failed container start — which is the point. A
regression that turned one into a silent skip would leave an ORM-unreadable row
in a database the service reported healthy.
