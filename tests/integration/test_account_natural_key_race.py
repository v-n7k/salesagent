"""A create that LOSES the natural-key race must not surface as a 500.

Regression for #1535 Part 2, the concurrency half of salesagent-0njj.

0njj closed the sequential duplicate: ``AccountRepository.create`` refuses a key
that already resolves (the message), and ``uq_accounts_natural_key`` enforces it
(the invariant). Its own docstring notes the check "cannot replace the index (two
concurrent creates can both pass it)" — which is exactly the hole this file
covers. Two creates that both pass the pre-check race to the index; the loser
takes an ``IntegrityError`` out of ``flush()``, and nothing handles it.

Why that is worse than it sounds: the admin blueprint catches only ``ValueError``
(the pre-check's error), so the loser propagates an ``IntegrityError`` out of the
request and the operator gets a 500 for a condition the very same code path
explains politely one microsecond earlier. The occupied key is the SAME condition
either way — only the timing differs, and timing must not decide whether a caller
gets a usable message or a stack trace.

The race is made deterministic by holding both callers at a barrier AFTER the
pre-check and BEFORE the flush. Nothing about the failure is simulated: both
sessions are real, both pre-checks genuinely pass (neither transaction can see
the other's uncommitted row), and the ``IntegrityError`` comes from the real
unique index. Only the scheduling is pinned, because a test that relied on
wall-clock interleaving would be flaky rather than deterministic.
