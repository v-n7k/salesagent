"""Operator-registered creative/signals agents dial through the guarded MCP seam (salesagent-4n88).

``CreativeAgentRegistry`` and ``SignalsAgentRegistry`` used to build an
``adcp.ADCPMultiAgentClient`` (``_build_adcp_client``) to query OPERATOR-configured
agents — the tenant's own ``creative_agents`` / ``signals_agents`` rows, plus the
built-in default creative agent. adcp 6.6.0 exposes no client/transport/factory
injection point on ``ADCPMultiAgentClient`` (verified: its ``__init__`` takes
only ``agents``, ``webhook_url_template``, ``webhook_secret``, ``on_activity``,
``handlers``, ``signing``, ``adcp_version``), so that dial reached none of this
application's egress policy — address validation, IP pinning, redirect refusal
— at all (upstream ask: adcp-client-python#1004, open, blocked on a maintainer
design call as of this writing).

Fixed by routing the operator dial through
``src.core.utils.mcp_client.call_mcp_tool`` — the same guarded fastmcp seam
already used in this file for ``preview_creative``/``build_creative``, and
already proven redirect-refusing by ``tests/integration/test_mcp_client_egress.py``.
All four operator call sites reach it through one shared function,
``src.core.utils.operator_mcp.call_operator_mcp_tool``, which owns the dial,
the payload extraction and both seam-error mappings.
``_fetch_formats_operator``/``_fetch_signals_operator`` are now the only
operator-agent fetch paths; ``ADCPMultiAgentClient`` is gone from both
registries (confirmed by ``tests/unit/test_ruff_egress_bans.py``'s closed
exemption set, which no longer lists either file).

Same shape as ``tests/integration/test_mcp_client_egress.py``: an operator
agent answers ``302 -> <metadata stand-in>``, and the metadata stand-in's real
hit count over a real socket is the grade — not whether the call raised. A
pinned transport also refuses a wrong-host connect for its own reasons, so an
"assert the call failed" test would stay green even under the regression it
exists to catch (a followed redirect also ends in failure, just later). Only
the hit count on the redirect target distinguishes "refused" from "followed".
