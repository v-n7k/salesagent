"""The ci-test tenant and principal, seeded into every integration test database.

WHY A FIXTURE AND NOT A MIGRATION. ``alembic upgrade`` runs on container start in every
environment, so a tenant carrying the well-known ``ci-test-token`` in the migration chain
would exist in production with a live principal row — an auth bypass, not a hygiene
problem. And it would not work anyway: ``integration_db`` creates a UNIQUE database per
test (``tests/conftest_db.py``), so nothing seeded once on the container or in the
migration history reaches the database a test actually runs against.

WHY A FIXTURE AND NOT init_database_ci.py. That script seeds the Docker stack's single
shared ``adcp`` database with raw ``session.add`` calls. It is the right tool there and
the wrong one here: this needs to happen per test database, and this repo's rule is that
test data comes from factory-boy factories, never inline construction
(CLAUDE.md pattern #8).

This is pytest's setUp. Teardown is free: ``integration_db`` drops the whole database
afterwards, so there is nothing to undo and no state to leak between tests.

NOT autouse. Seeding a tenant into every database would change what tests that count or
enumerate tenants see, and the factories those tests use build their own. A test that
wants the well-known credential asks for ``ci_test_principal``.
