"""The combined revocation list we PUBLISH (#1291 A5 follow-up, salesagent-z6nr.27).

The pieces it grades: ``GOVERNANCE_REVOCATIONS_PATH`` in
``src/core/agent_identity.py``, ``src/core/signing/revocation_list.py`` beside
``trust_root.py``, ``SigningKeyRepository.all_revoked`` (the revoked-rows query),
``SigningSettings.revocation_interval_seconds`` (the declared cadence), and
``src/routes/well_known.py`` serving the document through the narrowed builder
seam.

Core Invariant under test: the combined revocation list is a THIRD projection of
the same ``signing_keys`` rows the JWKS and the adagents pin already project —
but its retention is UNBOUNDED where the JWKS grace window is not, because a kid
dropped from ``revoked_kids`` is a kid UN-REVOKED.

Spec grounding (reproducible:
``git -C ~/projects/adcp show v3.1.1:docs/building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx``):

* **:1543 is the MUST that binds us** — "Signers MUST publish revocations via the
  same combined revocation list used for request signing". It binds us as a
  SIGNER of outbound requests and webhooks, which is why this is the publisher
  half and lives next to ``trust_root.py`` rather than inside A5's inbound
  verifier.
* **:1328** scopes the combined list: ``revoked_kids`` is what governs request
  signatures. ``revoked_jtis`` is NOT used for them, so its absence from our
  payload is a decision this suite asserts, not an omission it tolerates.
* **:717** bounds the declared cadence (floor 1 min, ceiling 30 min) and
  **:1103** binds the published brand.json cache TTL by that same interval.
* **:1079** (governance keys served from a separate origin) is knowingly
  diverged from: this document is signed with the tenant's request-signing key,
  self-consistent with our OWN consumer — ``CounterpartyRevocationChecker``
  resolves a published list's ``kid`` through the counterparty's request-signing
  JWKS — but not the governance-key profile. Follow-up: ``salesagent-z6nr.37``.

Why the assertions are written the way they are:

* **On the SERVED BYTES, never solely "our consumer accepts it".** The whole
  point of publishing is that a THIRD PARTY can verify. A suite that grades the
  document only by handing it back to ``CachingRevocationChecker`` lets producer
  and consumer agree on a wrong format together — the
  encoder-tested-by-its-own-decoder trap. So the protected header and the
  payload are decoded from the wire and their member sets pinned by name, and
  the signature is checked with RAW ``cryptography`` primitives against the
  public key off our OWN published JWKS. The SDK's ``verify_detached_jws`` runs
  too, but as a SECOND opinion from outside ``src/``, not as the primary
  authority.
* **The revoked key is aged past the grace window on purpose.** That is what
  separates the new query from ``publishable_at``: the same kid must be GONE
  from the JWKS and STILL PRESENT in ``revoked_kids``. A test that revoked a key
  and read both documents one second later would pass against a revocation list
  that was merely ``publishable_at`` filtered to revoked rows.
* **The active key is minted through production** (``provision_signing_key``),
  not fabricated by a factory: the route has to RESOLVE a private half to sign
  with, and a factory row's ``env:`` reference has no material behind it.
