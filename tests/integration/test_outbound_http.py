"""Integration tests for the outbound egress seam (`src.core.security.outbound_http`).

Every case drives the real seam against a real local origin. Nothing is mocked:
no patched ``getaddrinfo``, no substituted transport, no faked ``httpx``. The
refusals under test are genuinely produced by the live ``adcp.signing``
validator against real addresses — ``127.0.0.1`` really is in a reserved range
and ``169.254.169.254`` really is a cloud-metadata address — so a mock could
only restate the assertion, never grade it. The same goes for the two facts
that matter most here: "the redirect was not followed" and "the 404 was not
retried" are only provable by counting hits on an origin that actually ran.

Spec grounding: AdCP 3.1.1, ``building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx``, "Webhook URL
validation (SSRF)". A fetcher MUST (1) reject non-HTTPS in production, (2)
reject reserved ranges, (3) pin the connection to the validated IP, (4) refuse
redirects, (5) cap size and timeouts, (6) not echo fetch errors back to the
party that supplied the URL. Conformance storyboard: ungraded — this is an L1
security obligation, not a wire contract.

Every case runs for BOTH ``send`` and ``asend``: the async twin is a separate
code path and an untested one would ship the epic's defect in half the repo.

    ``field`` is a PASSTHROUGH: the seam sees a URL string, not a request

    carries the one the caller supplies, because the caller is the only party
    that knows whether the refused URL came off the wire and under which name
    (``core/error.json`` @3.1.1: ``field`` is a path into the REQUEST PAYLOAD).

    The second half pins the default: a caller that supplies no ``field`` gets
    no ``field`` KEY, not a null. That default is what almost every call site
    wants: there are no unmigrated sites left, and the migrated ones that fetch

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 12. Verdict parity — one address predicate, two verdicts (GH #974)
#
# The seam offers a resolve-and-dial verdict only. A URL that is STORED at ingest
# and fetched later needs a second, DNS-FREE verdict at registration time,
# because an unresolvable but public hostname must be ACCEPTED then and
# re-checked when it is actually dialled. That second verdict was built OUTSIDE
# the seam (``src/core/security/url_validator.py``), and once outside it grew its
# own range set — which then drifted: the six ranges below are refused at ingest
# and dialled happily (GH #974, the live gap this section closes).
#
# So the obligation is not "each verdict refuses bad URLs". Two independent
# copies of address policy satisfy that too, and that IS the disease. It is that
# the two verdicts agree row for row, diverging only on the two axes they are
# DEFINED to differ on: DNS (registration performs none) and the loopback
# allowance (registration-only, for capture servers under ADCP_TESTING).
#
# The tables are stated HERE and never derived from the policy module's own
# frozenset. A row read out of production would vanish along with the CIDR a
# mutation deletes and the test would stay green — and the mutations are where
# this section's teeth are:
#
#   * drop ONE entry from the policy's supplement frozenset and the matching row
#     reddens in BOTH ``test_a_supplement_range_is_refused_at_registration`` and
#     ``test_a_supplement_range_is_refused_at_dial``. Two rows, one edit: that is
#     the proof the address predicate is genuinely shared rather than two copies
#     that happen to agree today. At HEAD, with two range sets, no single edit
#     can do it.
#   * drop the FLAG half of the shared predicate (leaving only the supplement
#     frozenset) and ``test_a_reserved_range_is_refused_at_registration`` reddens
#     while its dial twin ``test_reserved_range_is_refused_by_validate_url``
#     (section 11) stays green — adcp.signing catches those classes
#     independently, and registration never reaches adcp.signing. That asymmetry
#     is the proof the flag half is load-bearing for the DNS-free verdict
#     specifically rather than decorative.
#   * put the supplement half of the dial check back behind the private-range
#     hatch and ``test_a_supplement_range_stays_refused_with_the_private_hatch_
#     open`` reddens on all six rows while its hatch-CLOSED twin stays green.
#     That pair is the proof the supplement set is outside the hatch rather
#     than merely refused in the default posture: the hatch is the seam's ONE
#     remaining posture knob, so a set no posture can open is a set nothing can
#     open. Registration's column is unaffected by construction —
#     ``check_registration`` takes no ``allow_private`` parameter at all.
#   * add a range to the policy's frozenset without adding a row here, or
#     delete a row here whose CIDR is still in production, and
#     ``test_the_supplement_oracle_table_covers_the_production_set_exactly``
#     reddens. That case is the CONVERSE of the hand-stated rule above and the
#     only one that reads production: it computes no verdict, it asserts the
#     two sets correspond one-to-one, so a new range cannot arrive ungraded and
#     a row cannot outlive the range it grades.
#
# The dial half of every row is graded through ``validate_url`` rather than
# ``send``/``asend`` for one reason: an accepted row would otherwise open a real
# socket to a reserved address and hang until the connect timeout. Section 10
# already pins validate_url's verdict against send's and asend's case for case,
# so nothing is lost by grading the address decision on the entry point that
# makes no connection.
#
# Every case writes the private-range hatch explicitly, dial-only rows included.
# The registration verdict takes its loopback allowance as a PARAMETER and reads
# no environment of its own — so a future implementation that quietly read the
# seam's hatch instead would be graded here rather than passing by accident.

# step. These cases grade it THROUGH the seam and never in isolation: the
# machine is pure, so a direct test of it would say nothing about which loop
# obeys it. Each case therefore records the machine's own decisions as well as
# the outcome, because the outcome alone cannot tell the two shapes apart — a
# loop that decided for itself raises exactly the same error and records no
# decisions at all.
#
# Sleeps are recorded rather than served, as section 13 does, and for a sharper
# reason here: these origins send a real ``Retry-After``, so a case that reached
# an actual sleep would wait the origin's number out for real.
