"""Guard test for the A2A update_media_buy submitted contract (PR #1567 follow-up).

A manual-approval update_media_buy driven through the REAL A2A
``on_message_send`` pipeline yields a Task with state=TASK_STATE_SUBMITTED and
NO artifacts — the submitted early-return fires BEFORE the artifact loop, so no
serialized submitted body ever crosses the A2A wire. (The create-side twin of
this pin lives at
tests/integration/test_a2a_skill_invocation.py::test_explicit_skill_create_media_buy_manual_approval;
no test pinned the update side at the Task level before this one — the BR-UC-003
a2a BDD scenarios grade the submitted ENVELOPE, but the harness synthesizes that
envelope from Task state alone and never asserts artifact absence.)

Honesty notes:
- The assertion is on the raw Task captured by the harness
  (``env.last_a2a_task``), because the harness's parsed submitted response is
  SYNTHESIZED from Task state + id (tests/harness/_base.py) and by itself
  cannot prove that the server attached no artifacts.
- Only the ad-server adapter is mocked (the external boundary — flipped to
  manual-approval mode) plus the audit/context-manager seams MediaBuyDualEnv
  always patches; message parsing, skill routing, auth, the shared
  ``_update_media_buy_impl``, and Task/artifact framing are all real, and the
  media buy row lives in real PostgreSQL.
