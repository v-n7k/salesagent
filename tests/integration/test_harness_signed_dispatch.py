"""salesagent-n78j0.1.1: the cross-transport env can send a SIGNED request.

The #1757 review's central finding: the headline property this work exists to
provide — a signed request accepted, an unsigned one refused, identically on
every transport — was asserted by code shape and never OBSERVED, and that is
what let the A2A credential-location bypass through. This file is the only
place the harness's signing is observed end to end.

SCOPE. All four WIRE legs. The three IN-PROCESS ones — ``rest``, ``a2a``,
``mcp`` — share one pair, driven from one parametrization rather than three
copies: the rules a signed dispatch must obey are identical on every transport,
so a per-leg copy of the pair would be the duplication the project treats as a
correctness defect (CLAUDE.md, DRY). ``e2e_rest`` is graded HERE TOO, by the
third test, on the same env and through the same ``call_via`` seam — relocating
it into a per-transport module of its own is exactly the cheapest-path failure
(SF-5) this whole epic exists to undo.

WHY ``e2e_rest`` NEEDS ITS OWN TEST RATHER THAN A THIRD PARAMETRIZATION. Not
because the property differs — it is the same property — but because the leg
crosses a PROCESS boundary and the oracle below cannot. ``verifier_spy`` patches
the verifier in THIS process; the live server's verifier runs in another
container. Two observables do cross, and both are wire facts:

* ACCEPTED: ``adcp_request_signature_verified_total{operation,keyid}`` scraped
  over HTTP, incremented by EXACTLY 1. ``record_signature_verified`` has one
  call site in ``src/`` — ``src/core/signing/verifier.py``'s
  ``verify_inbound_signature``, which #1721 runs inside ``_resolve_identity`` at
  the request boundary rather than in an ASGI middleware above it — on the
  branch reached only after ``_run_verifier`` returns without raising. Being POSITIVE, the usual
  objection to a metric delta — that a zero is equally produced by an
  unresolvable counterparty, a ``none`` bucket or a 404 scrape — does not apply:
  a 404 scrape yields NO samples and errors, and every ambiguity listed produces
  0, not 1. The per-capability ``keyid`` is what makes "exactly 1" a claim about
  THIS request rather than about the server's cumulative session.
* REFUSED: the byte-exact ``WWW-Authenticate: Signature error="..."`` challenge,
  read with ``rejection_code``. A bare 401 is satisfied by auth middleware
  rejecting first, by a 404 wearing a 401, and by a malformed-header precheck.

Because those two observations are a scrape window and a challenge header rather
than a spy, they belong in ONE sequenced test (scrape -> signed -> scrape ->
unsigned) instead of two independent ones.

WHY THE ORACLE IS ``verifier_spy`` AND NOT THE STATUS CODE. A 200 does not mean
"the signature was accepted" — it is equally true of a boundary that never
verified the request. Under ``required_for`` an unsigned request carrying a
VALID bearer is also 200, and correctly so: security.mdx :1269 says such a
request MUST NOT be rejected for the missing signature (only an unacceptable
credential, :1268, is refused). So status alone cannot distinguish "signed and
verified" from "unsigned and waved through" — the first draft of this file got
that wrong. ``verifier_spy`` records what the REAL verifier was handed and what
it returned; ``VerifiedSigner.key_id`` is the positive-path observable that
proves the signature this seam produced was actually verified.

class _SignedDispatchEnv(BareIntegrationEnv):
    """One env that reaches ``get_adcp_capabilities`` through all three legs.

    ``BareIntegrationEnv`` carries the real DB session and factory binding but
    no adapter mocks, which is all a signature check needs: the request is
    accepted or refused by the middleware before any domain handler runs, and
    capabilities assembly degrades gracefully when the adapter lookup fails
    (``src/core/tools/capabilities.py``), so no stand-in has to be installed for
    the call to complete.

    One env rather than one per transport, because the subject under test is the
    ENV's signing capability: a per-leg env would let the legs drift on identity,
    posture or operation and the cross-transport claim would stop being one
    claim. The REST leg keeps the raw dict parser the spike used — its subject is
    the signature, not the payload shape, and the typed parse is already graded
    by ``CapabilitiesEnv``'s own suites.

    DISPATCH DECLARATION, NOT DELEGATION METHODS. The a2a and mcp legs are
    declared (``A2A_SKILL``/``MCP_TOOL``/``RESPONSE_MODEL``) and driven by
    ``BaseTestEnv.deliver_a2a``/``deliver_mcp``, which own the ONE dispatch path

    are :data:`SIGNED_OPERATION` rather than literals, because the whole file's
    comparability rests on all three legs resolving to the SAME graded
    operation: a literal here could drift from the operation the posture puts in
    ``required_for``, which would silently move the leg into the ``none`` bucket
    and pass a signed request through unverified. The env keeps its signing
    behaviour unchanged — ``signed`` never travels in ``**kwargs``; it is
    consumed by the dispatcher and read back off ``_signed_dispatch`` inside
    ``_run_a2a_handler``/``_run_mcp_client``, which is what those base methods
    already did when this env called them by hand.

    """The positive oracle, stated once for every leg.

    *expected_key_id* is the capability's OWN kid rather than the shared module
    constant: since the e2e leg's oracle is a metric series labelled by ``keyid``,
    every capability now mints a kid of its own (see
    ``signing_capability.unique_run_id``). Asserting against the capability makes
    this a strictly stronger claim than the constant was — the signature must be
    verified under the key THIS env published, not merely under a key named like it.

    Exactly ONE GRADED verification is the claim, and it is a claim in its own
    right on the MCP leg: an MCP session puts SEVERAL requests on the wire
    (``initialize``, ``notifications/initialized``, the ``tools/call``, the
    session ``DELETE``), all of them SIGNED by the harness, and only the
    ``tools/call`` resolves to a graded operation. The others name a protocol
    method with no declared bucket, or no operation at all, so they fall in the
    narrowed ``none`` bucket.

    Those frames DO reach the verifier — ``security.mdx`` :1226 binds a verifier
    to pre-check a signed request "even for operations not in ``required_for``",
    and they are signed and on an AdCP surface. They clear the pre-check, fail
    step 7 against the empty resolver the narrowed ``none`` path supplies BY
    CONSTRUCTION, and pass through. So counting verifier INVOCATIONS stopped
    being a proxy for "one graded verification" when the verifier gained its
    pre-check phase; it now counts pass-throughs too.

    Counting frames that reached a VERIFIED outcome states the obligation
    directly and is strictly stronger. Two above one still means session frames
    were graded as operations — the failure this guards — and zero still means
    the request never reached the verifier at all. What it no longer reddens on
    is a pre-checked pass-through, which is specified behaviour.

    #1721 can only narrow that further, never widen it: verification moved into
    ``_resolve_identity``, which ``invoke_tool`` reaches only once
    ``TOOLS[tool_name]`` resolved, so a session frame naming no tool may not reach
    the verifier at all now. Counting VERIFIED outcomes is what makes this
    assertion indifferent to which of the two holds — either way exactly one frame
    is graded, and both of the failures above still redden it.

    WHY A CREDENTIAL-LESS CALL. security.mdx :1269 makes an unsigned request
    carrying a valid bearer a spec-correct 200, so ``signed=False`` ALONE never
    reaches the verifier's refusal branch. ``credential={}`` — #1721's spelling of

    WHY NOT ``status_code == 401``. Because a 401 is equally produced by the auth
    middleware rejecting first, by a 404 wearing a 401, and by the
    malformed-header precheck — and because a status-shaped oracle on this path
    has already been observed to be vacuous: forcing a leg to dispatch UNSIGNED
    in salesagent-n78j0.1.1 left ``is_success`` passing.

    The three negatives are the assertion's own non-vacuity, graded rather than
    argued: the wrong (but real) code fails, a code outside the verifier's
    vocabulary fails, and — the one that matters — an ACCEPTED dispatch fails
    instead of being read as a refusal.

    ONLY THE REST LEG, and here that is not a limitation but a division of labour:
    this test's subject is the helper's NON-VACUITY — the three negatives below —
    which is a property of the helper and identical on every leg, so running it
    three times would grade the same code three times. That the refusal itself is
    reachable and correctly graded on ``a2a`` and ``mcp`` is the next test's claim,
    across all three. It was not always so: both JSON-RPC readers discarded the HTTP
    response on a 4xx, so neither could produce a refusal to grade at all

    NOTHING graded it either. It was believed by reading, which is the epic's own
    headline failure mode.

    It has to be re-stated the moment ``signed`` stops being a bool: these legs
    deliver through ``AdCPTestClient``, which never reaches ``wire_request``, so a
    MALFORMED signature has exactly as little meaning there as a valid one, and a

# LOCK 2 WAS HERE, and is deliberately gone — not repaired, and not replaced by a guard.
#
# It graded that a refusal lands on the OPERATION frame rather than on the handshake, by
# reading the refused frame's JSON-RPC method and its ``mcp-session-id``. Under #1721 that
# is not a property to observe at runtime; it is a property of the construction, and two
# facts make the failure mode unrepresentable:
#
#   * ``_resolve_identity`` has exactly ONE call site — ``src/core/tools/_boundary.py``
#     inside ``invoke_tool`` — so the verifier is reachable only through a dispatched tool;
#   * MCP ``initialize`` is FastMCP's handshake, served by ``mcp.http_app()`` before any of
#     this repo's code runs. It never reaches ``invoke_tool``, so it never reaches the
#     verifier.
#
# There is no change short of wiring verification into FastMCP's ``initialize`` that makes a
# handshake frame carry a signature refusal, and that is not a mutation — it is a revert of
# the architecture. The lock's own recorded mutation already failed to redden it, which was
# the symptom rather than the disease. Its ``mcp-session-id`` discriminator had additionally
# become an assertion about a deleted artifact: ``src/app.py`` mounts MCP with
# ``stateless_http=True`` (9d1bd704f), so no session id is minted for it to read.
#
# A test here would be a guard on an unrepresentable state, and this repo does not write
# those — the same ruling that took the 28 request-signature error classes to hand-written
# declarations with nothing scanning for violations. The architecture was built to make this
# class of mistake impossible in principle, and a mistake that cannot happen does not need a
# test watching for it. THE OBLIGATION IS NOT LOST: it moved from observed-at-runtime to
# guaranteed-by-construction, and the two facts above are where it now lives.
#
# Nothing was rehomed, because nothing needed rehoming. The one surviving assertion in the
# deleted lock (``assert_signature_challenge``) was documented IN THAT TEST as shape
# documentation and explicitly NOT the discriminator — it passed under the lock's own
# mutation — and the same challenge is graded for real by
# ``test_refusal_is_graded_by_the_challenge_not_by_the_status`` above.
