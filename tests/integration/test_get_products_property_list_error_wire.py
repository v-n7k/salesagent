"""A server-side property-list failure must not reach the buyer as their mistake.

``_get_products_impl`` wrapped every non-``AdCPSalesAgentError`` out of
``resolve_property_list`` in ``AdCPValidationError``, whose recovery the code table supplies.
Two things are wrong with that on the wire, and only the wire can show them:

1. The buyer is told ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` — "your request is malformed" — for a
   fault entirely on our side (an ``AttributeError``, a ``TypeError``, a DNS
   failure inside the resolver).
2. The branch forced ``recovery="transient"`` while the pinned AdCP enum classifies
   ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` as ``correctable``. The buyer is simultaneously told the
   request is invalid AND that retrying the identical request may work.

Graded on ``wire_error_envelope`` across every transport that can carry this
request — see the REST note on ``_WIRE_TRANSPORTS`` below.
Asserting on the raised exception object instead would grade the plumbing, not
the contract the buyer reads — and an ``_impl``-level ``pytest.raises`` cannot
see the recovery hint at all, which is half the defect.
