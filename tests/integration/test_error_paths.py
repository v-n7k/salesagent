"""The REST transport boundary leaves the same persistent audit trail as MCP and A2A.

Merge note (feature/spec-gaps-1210 x origin/main): this file was deleted on the
feature branch by "make buyer-facing error text unauthorable, and delete what
watched for it", whose stated destination for its contents was that "the envelope
is graded on the wire by BDD across mcp/a2a/rest/e2e_rest; a second non-BDD grader
is a copy that drifts". That is true of every envelope/recovery/serialization test
this file used to carry, and those are gone for good:

* the parametrized REST recovery propagation and the NOT_FOUND both-layers case ->
  ``tests/unit/test_error_boundary_translation.py::TestRestStatusCodeRoundtrip``,
  which drives each typed class through the real handler stack and grades both
  envelope layers via ``assert_envelope_shape``;
* ``to_dict()`` recovery roundtrip -> the method no longer exists; recovery is a
  read-only property over ``CODE_TABLE`` and is graded on both wire layers by
  ``assert_envelope_shape`` on every use;
* malformed-creative handling -> ``tests/integration/test_creative_validation_rest_obligations.py``
  ``TestMissingFormatIdRejectedThroughImpl`` (UC-006-EXT-E-01) and BR-UC-006's
  "the invalid creative should have action failed";
* invalid ``created_after`` -> ``tests/integration/test_creative_list_behavioral.py``
  ``test_invalid_created_after_raises`` (UC-006-EXT-C-01);
* ``Error`` / ``CreateMediaBuyError`` constructibility smoke tests -> the two files this
  line used to name are DELETED, because constructibility is not an obligation: both
  ``tests/unit/test_approval_error_handling.py`` (whole file) and the two media-buy
  response-compliance cases in ``tests/unit/test_adcp_contract.py`` asserted ``hasattr``
  and field presence over fields the models INHERIT from the adcp parent, which cannot
  fail. The surviving wire use of ``CreateMediaBuyError`` -- embedded in the
  seller-rejection webhook -- is graded end-to-end by
  ``tests/integration/test_admin_media_buy_reject_webhook.py``, and ``Error``'s
  CODE_TABLE-derived message by the exact-equality assertions in
  ``tests/unit/test_delivery.py`` and ``tests/unit/test_sync_response_account_contract.py``.

What did NOT move is below. ``_envelope_response`` in src/app.py resolves identity
best-effort from the request (``_best_effort_rest_identity``) purely so the REST
boundary can feed the tenant-scoped sinks that MCP and A2A already feed. BDD grades
the wire envelope and BR-SECURITY-001 grades the boundary LOG via caplog; neither
grades the persisted audit row, and no other test in the tree asserts an
``audit_logs`` entry with ``adapter_id == "rest_boundary"``. Deleting this class
would have made that whole best-effort identity path unobserved.
