"""The approval webhook, against a real origin and the real outbound transport.

Replaces ``test_webhook_notification_sent_on_success`` and
``test_webhook_retries_on_failure`` in ``tests/unit/test_order_approval_service.py``.
Both of those substituted ``httpx.Client`` and then read the call back off the
mock, which describes the transport ``_send_approval_webhook`` happens to use
rather than what it delivers: ``call_args[1]["json"]`` is the object the caller
passed, not the bytes that crossed the socket, and a mock's ``call_count`` is
the number of times a stand-in was invoked, not the number of requests a server
actually served.

Everything here is graded off ``OrderApprovalWebhookEnv``'s local origin, so the
assertions mean the same thing before and after the egress-seam migration —
which is the point: the transport symbol changes, the delivered bytes must not.

What is deliberately NOT graded here: the retry *spacing*. BR-RULE-029's
1s/2s/4s-plus-jitter schedule is graded once, in
``tests/integration/test_outbound_http.py`` through
``tests/helpers/backoff_assertions.py``. Re-asserting a delay per call site is
exactly the duplication the seam exists to delete.

One case is RED before the migration, on purpose:
the terminal-status retry case requires a 404 to cost exactly one request.
Today's hand-rolled loop retries every non-2xx, so it costs three. The seam
classifies retryable as ``{429, 500, 502, 503, 504}`` and treats everything else
— every other 4xx, every 3xx — as terminal, so adopting it is what turns that
case green. That behaviour change is named in the PR, not smuggled.

Why the signing obligations are graded HERE and not in BDD (salesagent-47n9.21):
``_send_approval_webhook`` has exactly one production trigger — the GAM adapter
body at ``src/adapters/google_ad_manager.py:757``, reached only when the
synchronous ``approve_order`` returns False — and that trigger fires it on a
daemon thread, long after ``create_media_buy`` already returned its response to
the buyer. No request/response cycle is in flight at webhook time, so there is
no wire envelope for a BDD ``Then`` step to assert on; and every media-buy BDD
env mocks ``get_adapter``
(``MediaBuyCreateEnv.EXTERNAL_PATCHES["adapter"]``), so the sole caller never
executes there at all. The identical rationale is already written down for the
sibling delivery-time refusal at
``tests/bdd/features/local-egress-ssrf-refusal.feature:45-51`` — "no
request/response cycle, so no envelope to grade" — and this module is the
integration locus that precedent points at. Do not re-open the question by
adding a scenario that would have to fake the trigger to reach the behaviour.
