"""Core Invariant (#1441): a webhook sender signs the bytes it sends.

A webhook sender must never hold a signer and a body serializer as two
independent decisions. The one correct pattern in this codebase
(``protocol_webhook_service.py``) serializes once, signs those exact bytes,
and transmits those exact bytes via ``content=``. The two senders pinned here
do not: each signs a re-serialization of the payload dict
(``json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))``, escaped
ASCII) and then hands the SAME dict to ``send(..., json=...)``, which lets
httpx serialize it independently a second time (insertion order,
``ensure_ascii=False``). The two serializations diverge in both key order and
byte encoding, so the signature never covers the bytes that cross the socket.

A receiver that verifies the HMAC over the bytes it actually received — the
only sound way to verify one — must reject every delivery from either sender
today. Both cases below recompute the sender's own signing formula, but over
``env.last_delivery.body`` (the raw bytes the origin actually received)
rather than over a re-serialization of the payload dict test-side — matching
the working pattern at
``tests/integration/test_protocol_webhook_egress.py::TestSignedBodyIntegrity``.
A test that recomputed from the payload dict instead would just reproduce the
sender's own bug and pass vacuously (see the existing, vacuous
``test_hmac_signature_valid_reproduces_from_payload`` in
``tests/integration/test_delivery_service_behavioral.py``, which does exactly
that).

Both cases are RED today. They must go GREEN only once each sender routes
through one shared serialize-once -> sign -> send(content=) function
(#1441's implementation), not by patching either recompute here.
