"""L2 — the 40 AdCP request-signing conformance vectors, through the REAL app.

#1291 B3 (``salesagent-z6nr.14``), design steps 5-9. The authoritative in-repo
grading of the verifier: everything before this ticket is plumbing, this is the
evidence.

Grading level L2 of three — read this before reading any assertion below
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* **L1** (``tests/unit/test_signing_conformance_signature_base.py`` +
  ``..._canonicalization.py``) — the signature BASE and the 31 canonicalization
  cases, over the vectors' ORIGINAL untouched URLs, against spec-authored bytes.
* **L2 (here)** — the 15-check ORDERING, the wire envelope and the error codes.
* **L3** — B4 (``salesagent-z6nr.15``), black-box, the vectors' own URL space,
  nothing re-signed, ``positive -> non-4xx`` graded literally.

**At L2 the harness signs a base produced by ``adcp.signing.canonical
.build_signature_base`` — the same canonicalizer ``verify_request_signature`` uses
— so signer and verifier agree BY CONSTRUCTION whatever they compute. That is
ACCEPTED AND DELIBERATE at L2, because canonicalization is already graded at L1 over
untouched URLs against spec-authored bytes. L2 asserts the checklist, not the
canonicalizer.** Do not "fix" the re-signing, and do not report L2 green as
canonicalization conformance.

**B3 is CHECKLIST conformance, not STORYBOARD conformance.** ``signed-requests
.yaml``'s first phase (``capability_discovery``) asserts ``request_signing.supported
== true`` on ``get_adcp_capabilities``. :func:`declared_posture` now writes the REAL
declaration onto ``tenants.capability_declarations`` through the repository and
patches nothing, so "can a tenant STORE a ``request_signing`` block" is answered here
by construction — but whether that block reaches the capabilities WIRE is still not,
and remains D1's (``salesagent-z6nr.20``).

Why the URLs — and, since #1721, the BODIES — are transplanted (D-B3-1, settled)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The vectors address ``/adcp/<operation>``, which names no row in
:data:`src.core.tools.registry.TOOLS`. Verbatim, all 40 would 404 in the router and
"pass" having graded nothing.

Their BODIES are on the same footing now, for a reason that did not exist while the
verifier was a middleware: ``src.core.tools._boundary.serve`` computes
``validated_request(...)`` BEFORE ``invoke_tool(...)``, and ``invoke_tool`` is what
resolves the identity and therefore what reaches the verifier. So a body
``create_media_buy`` refuses is answered ``INVALID_REQUEST`` (400) with the checklist
never run — the same silent non-arrival a verbatim URL produces, and measured as such:
every routed vector reported 400 before :func:`~tests.helpers.signing_vectors
.transplant_body` existed.

Both mechanical rules, what each preserves, and their per-vector consequences live in
:mod:`tests.helpers.signing_vectors`; the plan's completeness and the URL rule's
application are guarded in ``tests/unit/test_signing_conformance_plan.py``, and the
body rule by :func:`test_the_transplant_edits_only_what_the_dispatched_operation_forces`
below — which validates every routed row's wire body against the registry's own DTO, so
a row cannot go back to grading a 400.

Where the verifier runs now, and the five rows that cannot reach it
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The verifier is no longer an ASGI middleware with its own surface prefixes: it is a
call :func:`src.core.resolved_identity._resolve_identity` makes, after
``invoke_tool`` resolved ``TOOLS[tool_name]``. The operation is therefore the registry
key the boundary dispatched on, there is no URL→operation resolver and no fail-closed
``none`` bucket — and a wire URL naming no route 404s in the router without ever
reaching the resolver.

Five rows are on that side of the line (``VectorPlan.route_named is False``):
``positive/006``/``008``/``009``/``010`` (the pathological paths) and the verbatim
``negative/028`` (``POST /mcp``, the JSON-RPC protocol-method namespace, which the
a2a-sdk and FastMCP session machinery answer without calling the boundary at all).
:func:`test_unrouted_rows_never_reach_the_verifier` drives the four positives and
asserts exactly that, so the coverage boundary is a measured fact rather than an
omission. What they would have graded is graded elsewhere: their canonicalization at
L1 by ``test_signing_conformance_signature_base.py`` and
``test_signing_conformance_canonicalization.py``, and ``010``'s raw-path ``@target-uri``
derivation by ``test_architecture_signed_target_uri_raw_path.py``. ``028`` grades an
agent that DECLARES ``protocol_methods_required_for``, which this seller refuses to
store at all (``docs/design/request-signing-subset.md``), so the vector is inapplicable
by construction rather than ungraded — see
``tests/unit/test_signing_conformance_plan.py``.

Where the composition rule's first branch is decided
-----------------------------------------------------
``negative/001`` and ``negative/027`` are the unsigned rows with no credential the
seller accepts, and the spec's first branch says both earn
``request_signature_required``. ``verify_inbound_signature`` implements that branch
correctly and is graded directly by
``tests/unit/test_request_signature_composition_rule.py`` — but it only answers if it
is REACHED, and this module is the only thing that grades that end to end. It caught
the merge doing exactly the opposite: ``_resolve_identity`` refused an absent credential
(AUTH_MISSING) and a presented-but-unresolvable one (AUTH_INVALID) BEFORE it read the
signature, so both rows reported ``Bearer error="invalid_token"`` and the checklist
never ran. The verifier call is ahead of both refusals now, and the AUTH_INVALID one
still fires on the bearer the verifier could not rescue — see the step-4b comment in
``src/core/resolved_identity.py``. If either row reports a challenge other than
``Signature error="request_signature_required"`` again, that is where the regression is,
not in this driver.

Anti-vacuity, which is this ticket's entire failure mode
---------------------------------------------------------
* A POSITIVE vector is NOT graded by "non-4xx" — that is equally true of a request
  that never reached the resolver, of an exempted request, and of an inert posture.
  It is graded by an OBSERVED ``VerifiedSigner`` carrying the vector's keyid plus a
  ``verified_total{keyid}`` delta of exactly 1. (Literal ``non-4xx`` stays L3's: a
  transplanted positive dispatches ``create_media_buy`` against fixture data it names
  no product row for, so what it earns DOWNSTREAM of the verifier is not this
  module's claim and is not asserted here.)
* A NEGATIVE vector is NOT graded by ``status_code == 401`` — the resolver refusing
  the BEARER first (AUTH_MISSING / AUTH_INVALID) renders through the same
  ``AuthChallengeResponder`` and the same 401. It is graded by the exact
  ``WWW-Authenticate: Signature error="<code>"`` bytes, which only a signature
  refusal carries.
* Every case additionally asserts the RESOLVED OPERATION, and
  :func:`test_every_row_names_the_route_the_plan_claims` pins every row's
  ``route_named``/``expected_operation`` against the LIVE route table, so a future
  registry change cannot silently move a vector to the unrouted side — the
  silent-unverified shape this epic has hit at three separate layers.
* ``negative/016`` asserts submission #1 was ACCEPTED and #2 rejected. Preloading the
  replay cache would make the acceptance unobservable, which is the exact false-green
  the runner kit warns about.

Replay isolation — exact-pair deletes, NEVER a truncate
--------------------------------------------------------
``adcp_replay`` has no tenant dimension by design and every vector shares keyid
``test-ed25519-2026``, so "truncate for the vector's keyid" is a GLOBAL wipe: it
would erase the claims of ``test_request_signature_{middleware,operations,
revocation}.py`` running on other xdist workers, and ``negative/020``'s at-cap rows
would make their signed requests reject with ``request_signature_rate_abuse``.
Measured disjointness is what makes exact-pair deletes safe: none of those three
modules uses ``test-ed25519-2026`` — they mint their own keys.

Spec grounding: AdCP 3.1.1 (``adcp==6.6.0``), ``adcontextprotocol/adcp@v3.1.1``:
``docs/building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx`` §"Verifier checklist
(requests)" (15 checks, in order, short-circuiting) and §"Composition with fallback
authenticators"; ``docs/reference/url-canonicalization.mdx``. Graded by
``dist/compliance/3.1.1/universal/signed-requests.yaml``; ``016``/``017``/``020``
additionally gated on ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/test-kits/signed-requests-runner.yaml``.

    ``ignore=[]`` and with ``threading`` removed from the ignore list: the worker thread
    gets real time in every configuration.

    So the ``time`` MODULE REFERENCE in :mod:`src.core.signing.verifier`'s namespace is
    substituted instead — the module that now owns the checklist call, where the ASGI
    middleware used to. Narrower than freezing the process clock, which is the point:
    the DB's ``func.now()`` expiry math, the session clock and logging all keep real
    time, and the vectors' own bytes (``created``/``expires``/``nonce``) are preserved
    exactly — rewriting them would force a re-sign of vectors that must not be
    re-signed. ``time.time`` is the only attribute that module reads off ``time``, so a
    namespace carrying just that one is the whole substitution.
