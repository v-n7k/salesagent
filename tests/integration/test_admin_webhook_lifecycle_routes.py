"""The admin webhook lifecycle, graded through the real Flask routes.

salesagent-pldmk.16. An operator who registers a push-notification webhook must
be able to DEACTIVATE it, DELETE it, and RE-REGISTER its URL. Today none of
those three exits works, and each one fails in a way the operator reads as a
generic error:

* ``register_webhook`` (``src/admin/blueprints/principals.py``) raw-selects the
  table one line after constructing ``PushNotificationConfigRepository``, and
  the hand-written filter is ``(tenant_id, principal_id, url)`` with no
  ``is_active`` predicate — so a soft-deleted row blocks re-registration of that
  URL for that principal permanently;
* ``delete_webhook`` and ``toggle_webhook`` both filter on ``config_id``, which
  is not a column (the primary key is ``id``, ``models.py:2074``). Both are
  reached from ``templates/webhook_management.html`` (:129 and :447) with
  ``webhook.id``, so ``filter_by(config_id=...)`` raises ``InvalidRequestError``
  for EVERY row and both broad ``except Exception`` branches (:729-732, :759-761)
  render it as an operator-facing failure. Neither route has ever worked.

Why the routes and not the repository: the defect IS the hand-written filter in
the route. A repository call from a test body cannot execute
``filter_by(config_id=...)`` and would stay green through the whole deadlock —
which is exactly how it survived. Nothing is mocked: real Flask handlers, real
``PushNotificationConfigRepository``, real Postgres.

What is asserted, and what is deliberately NOT: the OUTCOME (which rows exist,
which id, which ``is_active``, which stored secret), never the
``InvalidRequestError`` text. An assertion on the exception message would pin
the bug in place instead of grading the fix.

Reads go through ``PushNotificationConfigUoW`` rather than a raw select, so the
cases are graded against the same repository the fix routes the routes through,
on a fresh session that cannot serve a stale snapshot of the handler's write.

Spec grounding: none applies — the admin blueprint is an internal operator
surface, not an AdCP transport, so there is no wire contract or conformance
storyboard step in play. The obligations here come from the ticket and from the
solution-review gate (``bd show salesagent-7r4vl.31``), not from the pin.

RED vs GUARD at HEAD (see the module's four cases below):

* the three lifecycle cases are RED — the behaviour does not exist yet;
* ``test_re_registering_an_active_url_does_not_rotate_its_stored_secret``
  PASSES at HEAD and is a REGRESSION GUARD against the fix's own new branch:
  the fix calls ``find_by_url(..., active_only=False)`` and reuses the found
  row's id, which silently overwrites a LIVE registration's HMAC secret unless
  the found-and-active case warns and leaves the row alone (gate correction 2).
