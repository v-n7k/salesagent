"""The creative-agent raw-MCP fetch, against a real origin and the real egress seam.

``CreativeAgentRegistry._fetch_formats_raw_mcp`` is the COUNTERPARTY-agent_url
fetch path (a buyer-supplied ``format_id.agent_url``) — the operator-agent path
moved onto the guarded fastmcp seam (``call_mcp_tool``, via
``call_operator_mcp_tool`` from ``_fetch_formats_operator``) in salesagent-4n88,
so this raw-JSON-RPC-over-asend method now has exactly the one caller. It issues its own outbound HTTP: once it
fetches through ``src/core/security/outbound_http.py``, scheme policy, address
validation, IP pinning, redirect refusal, the response-size cap, the retry
count and the backoff schedule all belong to the seam and are graded once, in
``tests/integration/test_outbound_http.py``. Re-asserting them here would be the
duplication the seam exists to delete, and patching ``httpx.AsyncClient`` — what
the unit tests this file replaces did — deletes all six at once.

What does NOT move to the seam, and is therefore graded here:

* **The error taxonomy.** The seam reports one class of failure
  (``OutboundDeliveryFailed`` / SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE / transient) with a typed
  ``http_status``. Only this application knows that a 429 from a creative agent
  is RATE_LIMITED, that a 4xx is terminal rather than transient, and that a
  REFUSED agent URL is a seller-side misconfiguration the buyer cannot fix.
* **The attempt count the buyer pays for.** A 5xx creative agent used to cost
  ONE origin hit — ``raise_for_status`` fired on the first attempt and the
  ``except httpx.HTTPStatusError`` branch raised immediately. Through the seam a
  5xx is retryable, so it costs three. That is a real, buyer-visible behaviour
  change on the ``create_media_buy`` path and it is graded by counting hits on a
  server that actually ran.

``ADCP_TESTING=true`` is autouse for the whole suite (``tests/conftest.py``), and
the public entry point (``get_formats_for_agent``) skips this path entirely for
an operator agent — only a COUNTERPARTY ``agent_url`` reaches it, ahead of the
testing short-circuit (see ``_is_operator_agent`` in creative_agent_registry.py).
The fetch is therefore driven directly — as the unit tests it replaces did —
because a test that went through the public entry points would assert on
formats that were never fetched.

Spec grounding — pinned AdCP 3.1.1, read with ``git -C <adcp> show v3.1.1:<path>``:

* ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/core/error.json`` — ``retry_after`` is a TOP-LEVEL member
  of the error object, ``"type": "number"``, ``minimum: 1``, ``maximum: 3600``,
  "Sellers MUST return values between 1 and 3600. Clients MUST clamp values
  outside this range."
* ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/error-details/rate-limited.json`` — enumerates
  limit / remaining / window_seconds / scope and models NO ``retry_after``. The
  ``details["retry_after"]`` this path emits today is not the spec's home for
  the value. (Named, not hidden: ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/test-kits/
  rate-limit-trip-runner.yaml`` reads ``error.details.retry_after`` twice, so the
  pinned spec is internally inconsistent here. ``core/error.json`` is
  authoritative for the EMITTED shape.)
* ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/enums/error-code.json`` enumMetadata —
  ``CONFIGURATION_ERROR`` = {recovery: terminal, suggestion: "surface to a human
  at the seller — the buyer cannot resolve a seller-side deployment
  misconfiguration and MUST NOT auto-retry"}. That is the grounding for the
  refused-URL branch: the creative agent's URL is the OPERATOR's registered
  endpoint, so VALIDATION_ERROR / correctable would tell a buyer to fix a field
  they never sent. ``RATE_LIMITED`` = transient, "retry after the retry_after
  interval"; ``SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`` = transient.

Conformance storyboard: **ungraded**. No scenario in ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/``
exercises a creative-agent egress failure; ``universal/error-compliance.yaml``
step ``validate_error_shape`` treats ``retry_after`` as an OPTIONAL field on any
error, which is documentary rather than a grade of this path.
