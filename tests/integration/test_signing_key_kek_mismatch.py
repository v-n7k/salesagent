"""salesagent-dn4i -- _private_half_is_resolvable must ATTEMPT A DECRYPT.

Core Invariant under test: a tenant's KeyBacking.signs must be True only when
THIS deployment can actually open the key's private half -- never merely
because SOME passphrase is configured.

``_private_half_is_resolvable`` (src/core/signing/posture.py) once returned True as
soon as ANY passphrase was configured, regardless of whether it was the RIGHT one
for a given row -- it never attempted a decrypt, so a rotated or per-environment
KEK made the wire say ``supported: true`` while every delivery raised. It now
ATTEMPTS the real resolution through ``resolve_signing_material``. This module mints
a key under one KEK, asks ``signing_key_backed()`` to resolve it under a DIFFERENT
one, and pins the honest answer: cannot sign. A failure here is that regression
returning.

IN-PROCESS ONLY: this grades the predicate's logic against a real database in one
process. The two-process proof -- the test runner minting under one KEK and a live
server container holding another -- is tests/e2e/test_signing_key_kek_mismatch_e2e.py.

Covers: salesagent-dn4i.
