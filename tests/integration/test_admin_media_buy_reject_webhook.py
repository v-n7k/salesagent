"""Integration regression: admin reject of a media buy must still fire the buyer webhook.

Bug found in PR #1567 review (adcp 6.6 / spec 3.1.1).
src/admin/blueprints/operations.py approve_media_buy() used to construct the RAW
library adcp.types.CreateMediaBuySuccessResponse in the reject webhook branch. Under
adcp 6.6 that raw type requires ``confirmed_at`` AND ``revision``; constructing it with
only media_buy_id/packages/context raises a pydantic ValidationError. The handler's
outer try/except swallows that error (flash "Error processing approval", 302), so the
buyer webhook SILENTLY never fired. The fix routes construction through our defaulted
subclass src.core.schemas.CreateMediaBuySuccess (status/confirmed_at/revision defaulted).

Behavioral guard: drive the admin reject route and assert the webhook service's
send_notification was awaited exactly once. Pre-fix the raw construction raises BEFORE
send, so send_notification is never called — that is what this test detects.

        """An admin approval is ONE status move, so revision must move exactly once.

        THE CONTRACT CHANGED, and this test previously graded the old one: ``bumps=2``
        and ``expected_status="active"``. That was two committed writes for a single
        approval — ``approve_media_buy`` resolved the flight-window status and committed
        it BEFORE calling the adapter, and ``execute_approved_media_buy`` then committed
        an unconditional ``ACTIVE`` over it. Both defects are real and both are named in
        the finding list: the buy was published as ``active`` before its flight window
        opened, and a buyer polling on ``revision`` was handed a token that
        skipped a value for one logical event.

        ``execute_approved_media_buy`` is now the sole post-adapter writer, and the route
        touches nothing after calling it. So the delta is 1, and the status is the
        flight-window rule's answer — ``scheduled`` here, because this fixture's buy is
        approved before its window opens.

        ``bumps`` is an EXACT delta, which is what makes this the grader for the
        single-writer property: if any caller reintroduces a second write, this fails
        rather than looking like a smaller-but-positive increase.
