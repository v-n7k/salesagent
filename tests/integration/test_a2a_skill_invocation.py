"""A2A skill registration: every advertised skill is a dispatchable registry row.

The invocation tests this file used to carry (explicit and hybrid get_products, create,
update, sync_creatives, list_creatives, delivery, the two-skills and unknown-skill
refusals) drove ``on_message_send`` in-process and graded transport behaviour. That is
graded on the wire by BDD, parametrized over a2a: BR-UC-001, BR-UC-002 (including the
manual-approval submitted envelope), BR-UC-003, BR-UC-004, BR-UC-006, BR-UC-018 and
local-pre-dispatch-refusals. The hybrid (text plus skill) invocation and the TextPart ==
DataPart.message equality have no scenario; they are listed as BDD gaps in the step-1
report rather than kept as unit tests of the transport.
