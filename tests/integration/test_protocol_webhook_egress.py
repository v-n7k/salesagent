"""Protocol webhook delivery, against a real origin and the real outbound transport.

``ProtocolWebhookService`` is the last outbound call site in this epic that owns
a LONG-LIVED transport: a module-lived ``requests.Session`` built in
``__init__`` and closed from a shutdown callback. It cannot survive the egress
seam. ``build_ip_pinned_transport`` resolves its destination once, at
construction, and both of its backends RAISE on reuse for another hostname
(``adcp/signing/ip_pinned_transport.py``: "The transport is single-host-scoped…
Build one transport per hostname you need to reach"), so a shared pinned client
is not a weaker pin — it is a non-functional one. The session removal is forced,
not preferred.

Everything here is graded off ``ProtocolWebhookEnv``'s local origin and the real
``webhook_delivery_log`` rows, so the assertions mean the same thing before and
after the migration — which is the point: the transport symbol changes, what the
buyer receives and what the operator can read back must not.

What is deliberately NOT graded here: the retry *spacing*, address policy, TLS
policy, redirect policy and the response-size cap. Those become the seam's
decisions and are graded once, in ``tests/integration/test_outbound_http.py``.
Re-asserting them per call site is exactly the duplication the seam exists to
delete.

Five cases are RED before the migration, and each names a LIVE bug rather than a
migration artefact:

``TestSignedBodyIntegrity`` (both cases)
    A buyer that verifies the HMAC over the bytes it actually received must
    accept the delivery. It does not today: ``_compute_legacy_signature`` signs
    ``json.dumps(payload, separators=(",", ":"))`` and returns exactly those
    bytes, while production signs with them and then transmits
    ``requests(json=)``'s spaced ``{"a": 1}`` form. The signature has therefore
    never verified — every HMAC-configured buyer endpoint that checks it has
    been rejecting these deliveries. A local origin that does not check
    signatures cannot see that, which is why it survived. The payload is
    non-ASCII on purpose: an ASCII payload would also be accepted by an
    ``httpx(json=)`` implementation (compact separators, but
    ``ensure_ascii=False``), so only a non-ASCII body grades the "transmit
    exactly the signed bytes" contract rather than coincidental agreement.

``TestDeliveryLogParity.test_terminal_status_row_records_one_attempt_and_the_status``
``TestDeliveryLogParity.test_exhausted_row_counts_every_attempt_that_was_made``
    Both fail on the same live bug, at
    ``protocol_webhook_service.py`` in the ``requests.HTTPError`` branch:
    ``status_code = e.response.status_code if e.response else None``.
    ``requests.Response.__bool__`` returns ``self.ok``, which is False for
    EVERY response that raised ``HTTPError`` — so ``status_code`` is
    unconditionally ``None`` there. Two consequences, both observed in the run:
    ``http_status_code`` is ``None`` on every failed delivery-log row (an
    operator cannot tell a 404 from a 503), and the ``400 <= status_code < 500``
    terminal branch is dead code, so a 404 is retried three times. Through the
    seam the status comes off ``OutboundDeliveryFailed.http_status`` and 404 is
    terminal, so both cases turn green. The 404-costs-one-request change is
    buyer-visible and belongs in the PR body beside the 429 and redirect ones.

``TestNoClientSurvivesConstruction``
    The regression guard against reintroducing a shared pooled client under any
    name. RED today because ``self._session`` exists.

``test_constructing_the_webhook_service_registers_no_shutdown_callback`` (in
``tests/integration/test_app_lifespan_shutdown.py``, where the lifespan fixture
already lives)
    Constructing the service must leave the shutdown registry untouched, and the
    real ASGI lifespan must still start and stop cleanly. RED today because
    ``get_protocol_webhook_service()`` self-registers ``close``.

Every other case below is GREEN today and must STAY green. That is the parity
requirement: the delivery-log metrics that are correct today, the audit trail,
and the ability to reach two destinations from one service instance are what the
migration must not cost.

    an outbound destination, so the URL ingest validated is the URL the seam
    validates, pins, and connects to.

    Regression pinned: ``protocol_webhook_service`` used to rewrite a
    ``localhost`` hostname to ``host.docker.internal`` BEFORE the URL reached
    ``asend`` (removed in #1589 follow-up). Under that rewrite the delivery
    leaves for a host that is not the buyer's endpoint and the origin below
    records zero requests — which is exactly how this test fails if a rewrite
    ever returns.

    The proof is read at the origin, not in production state: the ``Host``
    header on the request the endpoint actually served is the netloc the client
    dialled, so ``localhost:PORT`` recorded there is byte-for-byte evidence
    that nothing rewrote the destination in front of the seam.

    Determinism note: the origin binds whichever address family ``localhost``
    resolves to FIRST in this process (``serve_in_thread`` mirrors the seam's
