"""Ingest-time egress policy, graded through the real admin endpoints.

Admin write handlers accept URLs that are STORED now and fetched later, so the
refusal has to happen at ingest. These cases drive the actual Flask routes —
``POST /tenant/<id>/signals-agents/add`` and the tenant-management JSON API —
against a real database, because the obligation is not "``validate_url`` says
no" (``tests/integration/test_outbound_http.py`` grades that already) but "the
handler asks, and acts on the answer". Deleting the call in either handler has
to turn these red; that is the whole point of going through the route rather
than calling a helper.

Nothing here is mocked: no patched resolver, no substituted validator. The
refusals are produced by the live ``adcp.signing`` validator against real
addresses — ``169.254.169.254`` genuinely is a cloud-metadata address — so a
mock could only restate the assertion instead of grading it. Both escape
hatches are set explicitly on every case via the shared ``set_flags`` helper,
so a case never depends on ambient environment.

Two behaviour changes over the validator these handlers used to call, both
asserted below:

* the operator-facing message is opaque — the real reason (which names the
  resolved IP and distinguishes "cannot resolve" from "reserved range") reaches
  the operator through the logs instead of the response;
* plain ``http://`` is now REJECTED, where the old validator allowed it.

Spec grounding: AdCP 3.1.1, ``building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx``, "Webhook URL
validation (SSRF)" — point 2 (reject reserved ranges), point 1 (reject
non-HTTPS) and point 6 (do not echo fetch errors back to the party that
supplied the URL). Conformance storyboard: ungraded — an L1 security
obligation, not a wire contract.

# storyboard: nothing in dist/compliance/3.1.1/ sends a short credential, so
# grading cannot be cited either way and the schema is the only authority in
# play, so the pinned schema cited above is the whole ruling.
# The boundary value and the contract that grades it both live in

    """A 31-character HMAC secret is refused at ingest, naming the credential.

    Before salesagent-pldmk.8 this POST stored the row and flashed success: the
    coercion funnel's ``string_too_short`` refusal was caught, the document
    re-validated with a padded secret, and the buyer's short one put back — so
    the registration was refused much later inside the sender as
    ``credentials_too_short`` (``src/core/security/webhook_egress.py``), where no
    operator is on the call.

    That exemption was reachable from exactly two surfaces —
    ``src/a2a_server/adcp_a2a_server.py`` and ``principals.py`` — and this is the
    one its own justification never covered: the comment argues the A2A
    ``params.configuration`` envelope is a transport-layer parameter, and then
    the same helper is called from an Admin HTML form with no A2A anywhere.

    Asserted here, and why each half:

    * the ROW, because a flash-only assertion passes against a handler that
      flashes and then stores anyway — accept-then-never-deliver is the exact
      defect being removed;
    * the FIELD, because "it refused" is not enough: the sibling gate one field
      over refuses URLs, and an operator sent to fix a URL that is fine has been
      told the wrong thing. It is read off the declared refusal rather than out of
      the flash, because under ADR-010 the flash carries ``CODE_TABLE``'s sentence
      for the code and nothing else. The suffix is imported from
      ``tests.helpers.webhook_credential_refusal`` so this surface and the
      protocol surfaces cannot drift on WHICH input a short credential blames;
      the ``webhook.`` prefix is this route's own ``field_prefix`` (gh-#1895
      unifies the prefixes, and deliberately not here);
    * the CODE, because the two gates answer with different ones —
      ``INVALID_REQUEST`` for a document that violates the pinned schema against
      ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` for a schema-valid URL a deny-list refuses — which is
      the only part of the distinction that reaches the operator's screen at all;
    * that the SECRET is not echoed, because the flash is rendered back into the
      page and a credential belongs in no operator-facing surface (the reason
      this route stopped rendering stored credentials at all).

    BEFORE pldmk.8 this route ran TWO gates: ``redirect_if_url_blocked``
    (``principals.py`` → ``url_policy._is_allowed`` → ``outbound_http.validate_url``
    → ``EgressPolicy.resolve_for_dial``), which RESOLVES DNS, and then
    ``accept_push_notification_primitives`` → ``EgressPolicy.check_registration``,
    which is DNS-FREE by design. A hostname that is not a literal IP but resolves
    into a reserved range was therefore refused by the FIRST gate only.

    pldmk.8 deleted gate 1 at this call site (and ONLY at this call site —
    ``url_policy.redirect_if_url_blocked`` has eight other callers, all
    untouched). So this registration is now ACCEPTED and STORED. This test was
    INVERTED rather than deleted, so the trade stays visible in the tree.

    The trade is defensible and is why the inversion is the right fix, not a
    regression: the destination is re-resolved and IP-pinned at DIAL time by the
    one egress seam (``EgressPolicy.resolve_for_dial`` via
    ``adcp.signing.IpPinnedTransport``), so no byte leaves for a private address
    either way — and a registration-time resolution is a TOCTOU answer anyway,
