"""adcp-server's baked-in container uid can't use run_all_tests.sh's log mitigation.

Bug: salesagent-dhhlg. A live `cassini run` (sa-67ae7993, worktree
salesagent-sbsweep) crashed adcp-server at container startup with
``PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/logs/audit.log'`` even
though run_all_tests.sh pre-creates ``logs/`` (mkdir + chmod 2775 setgid) and
recreates each log file at mode 664, specifically so a second uid can append to
files the first uid created. run_all_tests.sh's own comment claims this is
"Verified live: ci:ci 0644 -> sacirunner:ci 0664".

That verification covers the INVOKING uid (whoever runs run_all_tests.sh)
versus the `tests` container's uid (``TEST_UID``/``TEST_GID``, derived from the
same invoker via ``id -u``/``id -g`` -- see docker-compose.e2e.yml's `tests`
service). It never covers adcp-server's OWN identity: the Dockerfile bakes a
FIXED uid/gid that has nothing to do with whoever invokes run_all_tests.sh --

    Dockerfile:117  RUN groupadd -r -g 1001 app && useradd -r -u 1001 -g app ...
    Dockerfile:138  USER app:app

-- and docker-compose.e2e.yml declares no ``group_add:`` for the adcp-server
service, so uid 1001/gid 1001 ("app") is never made a member of whatever group
owns the invoker-created log files. A file at mode 664 grants write only to its
owner and group members; adcp-server's baked uid is neither, so it falls back to
"other" (read only), and any attempt to open the file for append -- exactly what
``logging.FileHandler(path, mode="a")`` does, which is exactly what
``src.core.audit_logger`` did EAGERLY AT IMPORT on the salesagent-sbsweep
worktree (HEAD at crash time predated commit 9ad1ee66f, which made that same
import lazy and pointed adcp-server's own logs at a container-local
``ADCP_LOG_DIR`` instead of the shared bind mount) -- raises PermissionError.

These tests reproduce the mechanism directly against real Linux uid/gid
permission enforcement inside Docker containers (not a permission-bit
calculation in Python), using adcp-server's actual baked-in identity from the
Dockerfile and run_all_tests.sh's own mitigation steps verbatim. The fix:
docker-compose.e2e.yml's adcp-server now carries
`group_add: ["${TEST_GID:-0}"]`.
