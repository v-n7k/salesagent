"""The account natural key cannot be mutated out from under sync_accounts.

Regression for salesagent-8sfr.

``AccountRepository.get_by_natural_key`` resolves a buyer's ``sync_accounts``
entry to an existing account by (tenant_id, operator, brand.domain[, brand_id],
sandbox). Two of those components — ``operator`` and ``sandbox`` — were writable
through ``update_fields``, and the admin edit form wrote both. Changing either
silently RE-KEYS the account: the next buyer sync carrying the ORIGINAL natural
key no longer matches, so it provisions a DUPLICATE account for the same
brand+operator, and the buyer's existing account_id quietly stops being the one
their syncs maintain.

The consequence tests below assert that the buyer still gets ONE account rather
than only that the repository raises, because "the repository raises" is a claim
about our code while "the buyer's account still resolves" is the claim that
matters. They drive the REAL admin endpoint through ``AdminAccountEnv``: calling
``update_fields`` directly inside ``pytest.raises`` would go vacuous the moment
the fix landed, proving "no duplicate" by an exception rather than by the admin
operation being safe. The mechanism gets its own tests so a future caller that
bypasses the form is still refused.

Scope note: ``brand`` is the third natural-key component. No write path mutates
it (neither create path goes through ``update_fields``), so it has no
consequence test here — but it IS protected, and the guard in
tests/unit/test_architecture_natural_key_immutability.py is what keeps the
protection complete as the key evolves.
