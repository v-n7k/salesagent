"""One auth contract for every webhook sender, graded against real origins.

salesagent-47n9.24 (GH #1893, #1894). #1441 converged the
TRANSPORT — every sender dials through ``src.core.security.outbound_http`` and
``json=`` is unreachable from a signing sender. What did not converge is the
AUTH DECISION above it: three senders still answer "is this delivery signed,
and with what" three different ways, and two of them answer it wrongly.

The contract, stated once, is the one ``order_approval_service`` already keeps
(salesagent-47n9.20, graded in ``tests/integration/test_order_approval_webhook.py``):

1. The stored ``(authentication_type, authentication_token)`` pair becomes an
   auth decision in exactly ONE place — ``deliver_webhook``/``adeliver_webhook``.
2. A row that asked for ``HMAC-SHA256`` and has no usable secret DELIVERS
   NOTHING. Never unsigned. A buyer who asked for a signature will reject an
   unsigned POST, so sending one is strictly worse than sending none.
3. Signing is gated by the SCHEME, not by "is some credential lying around".
4. Only the CANONICAL spelling authenticates. A non-canonical one is refused,
   not folded -- probed: ``"bearer"`` returns ``refused_auth`` /
   ``scheme_not_in_spec`` at the seam, and ingest rejects it outright. Both
   spellings are nonetheless rows a real buyer can produce (the A2A
   ``setTaskPushNotificationConfig`` handler stores
   ``params.authentication.scheme`` verbatim from a free-form protobuf string;
   ``media_buy_create`` stores the pinned enum spelling
   ``AuthenticationScheme = ["Bearer", "HMAC-SHA256"]`` @ AdCP 3.1.1), which is
   why the refusal is graded rather than assumed impossible.

Every case here was RED until each sender routed its decision through the egress
seam — ``deliver_webhook``/``adeliver_webhook`` in
``src.core.security.webhook_egress`` (#1894). They went green by
CONVERGING on that seam, not by repairing the inline copies — repairing them in
place would have made each the fourth divergent copy, which is the disease
itself.

Why zero-hits is the discriminating assertion and not merely a small number:
each origin below is programmed to answer 200. A destination that would have
ACCEPTED the delivery is what makes "no request arrived" mean *the sender
refused*, rather than *the request went out and failed on arrival* — the
reading an origin programmed to reject would leave open. The same rationale is
written at ``test_order_approval_webhook.py::TestHmacSigning``.

Why these are integration tests and not BDD scenarios: neither sender runs
inside a request/response cycle. ``ProtocolWebhookService.send_notification``
is driven by the delivery scheduler and ``WebhookDeliveryService`` by the
delivery poller, both after the buyer's call has already returned — there is no
wire envelope for a ``Then`` step to assert on. The identical rationale is
already recorded for the sibling senders at
``tests/bdd/features/local-egress-ssrf-refusal.feature:45-51`` and in
``test_order_approval_webhook.py``'s module docstring.
