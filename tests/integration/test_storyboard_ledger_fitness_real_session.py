"""Fitness function for the storyboard-conformance ledger.

The mechanism graded here is DE-COLLECTION: a ledger entry that resolves to no collected
check must fail the session. Nothing else catches it. The ledger xfails NON-STRICTLY by
nodeid, and ``test_storyboard_conformance._collect_checks`` enumerates only failures and
skips, so a check that GRADUATES stops being parametrized at all — it produces no test
item, no xpass and no signal, and the entry becomes dead weight. An entry renamed
upstream goes the same way. ``tests/bdd/e2e_rest_known_failures.txt`` has its own
fitness function for the same reason (``tests/unit/test_e2e_rest_ledger_fitness.py::
test_every_ledger_entry_resolves_to_a_collected_item``).

Every case below drives a SYNTHETIC ledger, injected through
``STORYBOARD_LEDGER_PATH``, because ``tests/storyboard/known_failures.txt`` is empty:
the storyboard grades all of its checks, so no entry is routed to xfail. A mechanism
whose only subject is an empty file grades nothing, and this one has to keep working for
whenever an entry is seeded again.

**Why the e2e_rest test cannot be ported verbatim.** That one re-collects the
suite in a subprocess (``pytest tests/bdd --collect-only``) and joins the ledger
against the collected nodeids. The storyboard suite's parametrization is not
static: ``pytest_generate_tests`` SHELLS OUT TO A LIVE AGENT, and when the pinned
compliance/schema bundle cannot be RESOLVED it short-circuits to a single gate id
— ``bundle-not-present`` when the pin resolved and the bundle did not,
``environment-not-configured`` when even the pin could not be read.
(Resolvability, not env-var set-ness: the two
STORYBOARD_* vars are overrides, and the paths are derived when they are absent.) A verbatim port would therefore
declare every entry stale on every developer machine. The join must be computed
**in-session**, from the ids
``pytest_generate_tests`` itself produced — which means it only BITES in the
in-network job, where the runner really grades the agent. Everywhere else the
session is unconfigured and the fitness check must stay silent (graded by
``test_unconfigured_session_does_not_report_stale_entries`` below).

**RED direction.** The lane plan's original phrasing — "revert one ledger
entry's underlying fix and the test must fail" — is inverted: reverting a fix
makes that entry FAIL again, i.e. RESOLVE against the ledger, so the fitness
test passes. The failing case is the opposite one: a ledger entry whose check no
longer collects (graduated, or renamed) must FAIL.

This module drives real ``pytest tests/storyboard/test_storyboard_conformance.py``
sessions in a subprocess with the runner subprocess stubbed by an injected ``-p``
plugin, so the parametrized ids are produced by production's own
``pytest_generate_tests``/``LedgerCheckId`` code path against a summary this test
controls. No live agent, no npm deps.

**Why the nested session names the module and not the directory.** The three
cases below grade EXACT outcome counts ("exactly 1 failed item"), so anything
else the nested session happens to collect is counted as if it were the join's
verdict. ``tests/storyboard/`` also holds ``test_runner_sdk_pin.py``, which
asserts on the runner's INSTALLED ``@adcp/sdk`` and deliberately ``pytest.fail``s
when ``npm ci`` has not been run in ``tests/storyboard/runner/`` — a real,
correct failure everywhere except the one job that installs those deps. Pointing
the nested session at the whole directory therefore added exactly one failing
item to all three cases on every machine without the npm install (CI run
32152198573's "Integration (other)": ``{'failed': 2, 'xfailed': 74}``,
``{'failed': 1, 'xfailed': N}``, ``{'failed': 1, 'skipped': 1}`` — each one more
than expected), and passed only where a developer had happened to install them.
The subject under measurement here is the conformance module's parametrization
and ledger join, so that is what the session collects; the sdk pin guard is
unweakened and still graded by the storyboard-conformance job that owns its
precondition.
