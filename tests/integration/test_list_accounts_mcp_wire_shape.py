"""MCP wire shape for list_accounts: unset response fields must be absent, never null.

Regression for #1623. FastMCP's ``ToolResult`` serializes a raw
(non-dict) ``structured_content`` via ``pydantic_core.to_jsonable_python``,
which BYPASSES ``SalesAgentBaseModel.model_dump(exclude_none=True)``. 13 of
14 MCP tool wrappers (including ``list_accounts`` at
``src/core/tools/accounts.py``) pass the raw Pydantic response model
straight into ``ToolResult(structured_content=response)`` instead of
pre-serializing via ``response.model_dump(mode="json")`` — so ``None``
fields wire-serialize as JSON ``null`` on MCP instead of being omitted, per
AdCP 3.1.1 absent-means-absent semantics. A2A/REST both correctly call
``response.model_dump(mode="json")`` and are unaffected.

This mirrors the idiom in ``tests/integration/test_sync_creatives_mcp_wire_shape.py``:
dispatch through the real MCP transport via ``env.call_via(Transport.MCP, ...)``
and assert on ``result.wire_response`` (the real ``ToolResult.structured_content``
captured by the harness MCP client) — not on ``response.model_dump()`` at the
model level, which does not exercise the ``ToolResult`` boundary and would not
catch this bug (confirmed pre-existing unit/integration tests of this shape
pass despite the bug).
