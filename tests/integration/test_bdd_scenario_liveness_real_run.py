"""Real-run proof for tests/bdd/scenario_liveness.py.

The pure-logic tests live in ``tests/unit/test_architecture_bdd_scenario_liveness.py``.
This file is the grounding the parent finding demands: the liveness artifact must be
emitted from an ACTUAL BDD run, and a scenario with genuinely unbound steps must be
recorded as such — not asserted against hand-constructed dataclasses.

Shells out to two narrow, fast, real ``pytest tests/bdd`` slices (selected by the
``@storyboard-v3.1`` marker so the count of scenarios discovered matches what
``scripts/audit/storyboard_coverage_map.covered_storyboards`` claims as covered):

* UC-006's ``uc006-storyboard-routing`` scenarios landed real
  step definitions for all six (none are dormant/steps-unbound any more). Five
  genuinely xfail with a ``ledgered`` reason citing a real production gap
  (provenance validation, multi-format sync status); the sixth,
  format-id-roundtrip-on-sync, genuinely passes. Proves the artifact distinguishes
  ledgered-xfail from live-pass for scenarios that both have their steps bound —
  not just the steps-bound/unbound axis.
* UC-005's format-id-roundtrip scenarios, which pass for real on all three
  in-process transports. Proves ``steps_bound=True`` and ``harness_wired=True`` for a
  scenario that isn't dormant — a guard that only ever proves the negative case isn't
  a guard.

Needs a real Postgres reachable via ``DATABASE_URL`` (the harness these scenarios
exercise creates tenants/principals/products for real) — skipped otherwise, same as
every other ``requires_db`` test in this suite.

Two further obligations are graded here (steps 1-2),
because neither is observable from the pure-logic unit tests:

* **The artifact must survive xdist.** ``tox.ini`` runs the bdd env under
  ``-n auto``; ``_RECORDS`` is a per-PROCESS global, so a sharded run's
  controller writes the artifact from an empty dict while every measurement
  sits in the workers. ``test_liveness_artifact_is_identical_under_xdist_and_
  serial`` compares a sharded run against a serial one by SET EQUALITY of
  scenario ids plus per-scenario observation counts — never by non-emptiness,
  which a "let the last worker write" non-fix would satisfy with one shard.
* **Membership is keyed on the scenario's own ``@T-*`` IDENTITY tag**, with the
  ``@storyboard-v3.1``/``@schema-v3.1`` provenance tags RECORDED as a field
  rather than used as a collection filter. A provenance retag currently
  removes a scenario from the measurement silently; an identity tag cannot
  move under a retag. Every expected id here is DERIVED in-test from the
  feature file's own tags (via the single owner, ``storyboard_spec.
  tagged_scenarios``) — a re-frozen literal id list would be exactly the
  frozen-literal artifact this lane's Core Invariant forbids.
