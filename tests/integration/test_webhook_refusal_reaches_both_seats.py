"""A non-conforming registration refuses on BOTH seats — and only one of them has an outcome.

Epic D lane C4 (salesagent-fo99.4), section 10 of the change-set. Ruling #2 says
an authentication block that is not one of the two pinned schemes, or whose
credential is under the pinned ``minLength: 32``, is not a delivery we should be
making. That rule has to hold on both surfaces a stored registration can reach,
and the two surfaces are NOT symmetric:

  SEAT 1 — the ORM-row senders (``webhook_delivery_service``,
    ``protocol_webhook_service``, ``order_approval_service``,
    ``core/webhook_delivery``). They read ``authentication_type`` /
    ``authentication_token`` off a stored row and hand those primitives to
    ``deliver_webhook``, so the refusal happens AT THE SEAM and comes back as a
    ``WebhookDeliveryOutcome`` the sender consumes — that record is what re-keys
    the circuit-breaker failure and the sender's own bookkeeping. The record
    itself is graded next door, in
    ``tests/integration/test_webhook_delivery_outcome_contract.py``; what is
    graded HERE is that a real stored row reaches it and that the sender acts on
    what comes back.

  SEAT 2 — the A2A / workflow-step stash path
    (``ContextManager._send_push_notifications`` ->
    ``ValidatedWebhookRegistration.from_stash``). The refusal happens at
    REHYDRATION, before any sender is constructed, so there is NO outcome record
    on this seat and deliberately so: the outcome type has exactly one producer
    (the seam), and recording here would create a second construction site plus a
    delivery-repository write from the rehydration path — the half-migration Epic
    E would then have to undo. With no migration, no CLI and no durable record,
    this seat's LOG LINE is the only surface the decision has, which is why its
    content is asserted rather than assumed.

A grader that covered seat 1 alone would miss half the behaviour: the shapes that
stop delivering are reachable from both, and the seat-2 half is the one where
"stopped delivering" is invisible to every other observation the suite makes.

RED when authored, and for which reason (the resolver named here has since
been deleted; the seam now refuses both cases, which is what turned these green):
  * seat 1 — every case DELIVERED. The old resolver mapped an unrecognised
    scheme to an unauthenticated delivery and sent it PLAIN, and mapped a
    sub-32 credential to an ordinary bearer/signed variant, because there was
    no length gate at send time at all (``webhook_delivery_service.py``'s "No secret-strength gate"
    comment argues for exactly the tolerance ruling #2 removes).
  * seat 2 — ``from_stash`` deliberately tolerates both shapes today
    (``registration.py``'s "Rows written through the untyped A2A path carry any
    scheme spelling and any credential length"), so the delivery goes out; and
    the refusal it does make is printed through ``rich``'s ``console.print``,
    not logged, so no operator surface exists to assert on.

MUST STAY GREEN and untouched by this file: the BDD delivery scenarios in
``tests/bdd/features/local-egress-ssrf-refusal.feature`` and the UC-004 modules.

        Conforming on purpose: the row has to be one the ingest gate accepts, or

        STORED row does. The stash is then rewritten into the legacy shape — the

        this seat actually meets in production. The legacy shape is manufactured
        by :meth:`restash_authentication`, so what matters about this call is only
        that it leaves an ACCEPTED registration stashed on the step.

        The buyer signs, and that is a PRECONDITION rather than anything graded
        here. This request hands the seller webhook credentials, and security.mdx
        @ v3.1.1 :1462-1465 makes an RFC 9421 signature mandatory on such a
        request "regardless of ``required_for`` membership" (:1375) — enforced by
        ``registers_webhook_credentials`` (``src/core/signing/webhook_credentials.py``),

        ``required`` bucket by ``verifier._bucket_for`` and refused inside

        ``request_signature_required`` and NOTHING is stashed, so every case below
        would fail on a setup that never happened.

        Over MCP rather than A2A, which is what changed when signing became a
        precondition: ``tests/harness/_base.py``'s A2A-over-HTTP leg — the one an
        env takes once it can sign — answers ``-32601 Method not found`` and then
        raises through a stale ``AdCPError`` import #1721 deleted, so a signed A2A
        registration cannot be realized at all today. The transport of the
        REGISTRATION is not what this seat grades (the stored document is rewritten
        immediately afterwards, and rehydration reads a stash, not a wire), whereas
        registering unsigned would be asserting against a seller that does not
        verify — a posture this file has no reason to claim.

        The dispatch is asserted to have SUCCEEDED: a refused registration stashes
        nothing, and a later "0 deliveries" would then read as a refusal this file
