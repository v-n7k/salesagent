"""C2 (#1291) — the proof-of-control challenge is SIGNED and CONFORMANT, or not sent.

Core Invariant under test: *the challenge POST asserts this seller's identity, so it
carries an RFC 9421 signature a conformant receiver can verify against the JWKS we
publish, over a body that receiver is allowed to accept — or it is not sent at all.*

## Why this level, and why it is the acceptance's locus rather than a sub-claim

``NotificationProofService.prove`` has ZERO real coverage today, and it is worth being
precise about how it got there, because two different mechanisms hide it:

* every in-process transport replaces the whole prover with a ``MagicMock`` whose
  ``prove`` is a dict lookup (``tests/harness/account_sync.py``), so production's method
  body never executes;
* on ``e2e_rest`` the real prover DOES run, but the harness realizes a proof outcome by
  pointing the subscriber at a reserved-TLD host, which
  ``notification_proof_service`` refuses BEFORE the POST.

So a unit test of `prove()` would grade a method nothing else reaches, and the BDD suite
grades the FAILURE direction only. This module therefore drives the real
``sync_accounts`` tool end to end with the REAL prover restored, against a real database
and a key minted through production, and replaces only two true externals: the SOCKET
(``tests.helpers.webhook_wire``) and DNS. That is the acceptance's locus because every
clause of the acceptance is observable there and nowhere else together:

* the emitted signature verifies against **the JWKS A3 publishes** — which needs a real
  tenant, a real ``signing_keys`` row and the real publication path, not a fixture JWK;
* the challenge BODY is what a conformant receiver validates, and the body is only built
  on this path (``_resolve_activation_proofs`` threads the strategy and the seller agent
  URL in — a direct ``prove()`` call would let the test supply both and grade nothing
  about how production obtains them);
* "not proven" has to surface as ``action: "failed"`` plus a ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` at
  ``notification_configs[0].url``, which is a ``sync_accounts`` response field.

The signature is graded through the SDK's own verifier rather than by re-deriving a
signature base here: a test that recomputed the signature would be asserting our
implementation against itself. ``WEBHOOK_TAG`` is imported for the same reason — a literal
profile string would pass for a tag we never actually emit. The SDK's webhook ENTRY POINT
diverges from the pin on one value, so verification runs through
:func:`tests.helpers.signing.verify_as_conformant_receiver`, which substitutes exactly that value and nothing
else; the divergence itself is pinned by its own test so the substitution cannot outlive
it.

## Spec, at the version this repo pins (AdCP 3.1.1 via ``adcp==6.6.0``)

``sync_accounts.mdx`` :207 — *"The challenge POST itself MUST be signed with the seller's
RFC 9421 webhook profile key even when the candidate config selects legacy delivery auth
… The receiver MUST verify the RFC 9421 signature and MUST reject the challenge unless
``seller_agent_url``, ``delivery_auth``, and ``event_types`` match the pending
registration."* :235 — the challenge value MUST be cryptographically random and
single-use, and a non-2xx, malformed, mismatched or timed-out challenge means proof
FAILED. ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/core/webhook-challenge.json`` — SEVEN required properties
and ``additionalProperties: false``; ``delivery_auth.credential_fingerprint`` is the
sha256 hex of the legacy credential, required for the legacy modes and forbidden for
``rfc9421``. No 3.1.1 conformance storyboard grades this surface
(``notification-config-lifecycle.yaml`` puts active registration out of scope), so these
assertions are the only grader that exists.
