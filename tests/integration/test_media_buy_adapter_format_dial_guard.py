"""``create_media_buy`` re-dials a stored creative's ``agent_url`` with no adapter-format guard.

``_validate_creatives_before_adapter_call`` (``src/core/tools/media_buy_create.py``)
fetches a format spec for every referenced creative via ``_get_format_spec_sync``
(:405, and its ``_build_adapter_asset_from_creative`` sibling at :677), unlike the
creative-sync INGEST gate (``src/core/tools/creatives/_validation.py:138``,
``is_dialled_agent_url``), which skips external validation for an adapter-provided
pseudo-``agent_url`` like ``broadstreet://<tenant_id>`` — those formats are served
by the adapter IN-PROCESS (``src/core/tools/creative_formats.py``,
``src/adapters/broadstreet/adapter.py``), so there is no request to make and no
format-fetch that could ever resolve it.

The bug: neither call site in ``media_buy_create.py`` applies that same predicate.
A creative stored with ``agent_url="broadstreet://<tenant_id>"`` and
``format="broadstreet_<template>"`` reaches ``_get_format_spec_sync`` unconditionally,
which cannot resolve a format the adapter serves itself — the fetch returns ``None``
(no dialled agent advertises it) — and ``_validate_creatives_before_adapter_call``
treats an unresolved format spec as a rejection: "Creative ... has unknown format
... Format must be registered with the creative agent." A media buy carrying a
creative in the exact format the SELLER advertises therefore fails.

Residual left open by salesagent-7bfi's ingest gate: that gate is INGEST-time only
and gates ``sync_creatives``, not this RE-DIAL at ``create_media_buy`` time.

Conformance storyboard: ungraded (no scenario in ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/``
exercises an adapter-provided creative format on the create_media_buy path).
