"""Integration tests for the list_creatives concept_ids filter error path (#1407).

The happy path (filtering + concept_id/concept_name exposure) is covered by the
``@concept-id`` BDD storyboard scenario across a2a/mcp/rest. This module pins the
*error* path Chris flagged in review: a malformed ``filters.concept_ids`` (empty
array) violates the schema's ``minItems: 1`` and must be rejected — never silently
returning the whole library.

Two layers of guarantee:

1. **Rejected on every wire transport** (a2a/mcp/rest) — the malformed filter never
   degrades to "return everything".
2. **Spec two-layer ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` envelope with a recovery suggestion**
   (POST-F3) on every wire transport. REST and A2A coerce the wire dict through
   the shared ``coerce_creative_filters`` helper; MCP catches FastMCP TypeAdapter
   validation at the boundary and emits the same AdCP envelope.

Spec: ``core/creative-filters.json`` (concept_ids ``minItems: 1``) + the BR-UC-018
ext-c contract (validation failure → VALIDATION_ERROR + suggestion).

This module also hosts the list_creatives untyped-``data``-blob coercion guards: a
malformed ``concept_id``/``concept_name`` (``TestNumericConceptCoercion`` /
``TestNonScalarConceptValueDropped``, #1407), ``tags`` (``TestMalformedTagsBlobCoerced``)
or ``assets`` (``TestMalformedAssetsBlobCoerced``) value (#1508) in the blob must be
coerced or dropped-and-logged, never crash the whole listing on one bad row. Each guard
runs on every wire transport (a2a/mcp/rest): "the key is omitted" / "never null" is a
per-transport serialization claim, so REST-only would leave the MCP/A2A wire unproven.

Spec (coercion targets): pinned AdCP 3.1.1 (``adcp==6.6.0``, per docs/adcp-spec-version.md)
``creative/list-creatives-response.json`` types ``creatives[].tags`` as a non-nullable
``array<string>`` and ``creatives[].assets`` as an ``object`` — both optional (not in
``required``), so omission is conformant while ``null`` is not. Dropping a corrupt
(non-list ``tags`` / non-dict ``assets``) blob value to absent keeps the response's
top-level shape conformant; it is robustness, not a contract change. The ``assets``
coercion guarantees dict-ness only — a well-formed dict's inner asset-union values are
validated separately (#1779).

    guards (CLAUDE.md DRY): across those tests only the ``data`` literal and the per-test

    config — levels/handlers/propagation/``logging.disable`` — that suppressed
    capture-based approaches. ``ListedBlobRow.warnings`` is the ``logger.warning`` calls
    rendered to their final messages (``fmt % args``) so callers assert on the substituted
