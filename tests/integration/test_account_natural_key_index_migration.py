"""The natural-key uniqueness migration creates the index, and refuses dirty data.

Covers alembic revision b2e94f7c1a03 (salesagent-0njj).

Two paths, both otherwise unexercised. The integration suite builds its schema
with ``Base.metadata.create_all``, so nothing else runs this migration's SQL at
all; and the survey-and-abort branch only fires against a database that already
holds a collision, which by construction no other test produces.

The abort branch matters more than the happy one. Accounts are source-of-truth
rows, so the migration deliberately refuses to remediate: it reports the
colliding keys and stops, leaving the operator to decide which account survives
(owner decision, 2026-07-27). A regression that turned that into a silent
success would create the index over dirty data — impossible — or, worse, a
future edit that "helpfully" closed the extras would destroy live accounts with
no way back, since ``closed`` is terminal in the admin status transitions.
