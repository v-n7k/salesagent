"""Integration tests pinning salesagent-5yik's Core Invariant (C3 capabilities contract).

Core Invariant (salesagent-5yik): ``_get_adcp_capabilities_impl`` stays
transport-agnostic and honest -- every field on the wire (context echo,
filtered sections) is derived directly from the typed
``GetAdcpCapabilitiesRequest`` the caller sent, and REST carries that same
request shape via a real request body (owner decision 2026-07-24: a NEW
``POST /api/v1/capabilities`` route with a ``GetCapabilitiesBody`` JSON
body, matching the codebase's RPC-over-REST convention). It is now the
tool's ONLY REST route: the parameterless GET was a second shape for the
same tool and was deleted (salesagent-prkv.106.4).

These tests exercise the REAL REST transport end to end (real Postgres via
``CapabilitiesEnv``/``IntegrationEnv``, real FastAPI ``TestClient``, real
route table -- nothing patched about the route itself) so they fail today
for the right reason: no ``POST /api/v1/capabilities`` route exists yet
(405 Method Not Allowed), the ``context`` field is never echoed onto the
response, and ``protocols`` is never used to filter response sections.

Covers: salesagent-5yik (Core Invariant + Implementation Plan steps 1-6).
