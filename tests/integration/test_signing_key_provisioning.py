"""Integration tests for tenant signing-key PROVISIONING (#1291, salesagent-7x8t).

Written TDD RED and now green: the first six groups grade the provisioning
transports the ticket built -- the admin blueprint
(``src/admin/blueprints/signing_keys.py``, design step 5), the scripted path
(``scripts/ops/provision_signing_key.py``, step 6), the
``signing_keys.private_key_pem_encrypted`` column that holds every minted private
half (steps 1-3), and the KEK gate (step 2). Each group names the production
module it fails for, so a regression reports which one went away.

Core Invariant under test: every ``signing_keys`` row is born through exactly ONE
function, which does not complete unless the private key behind the row resolves
and round-trips to the public JWK the row publishes -- so the agent can never
publish a key it cannot sign with, and never holds plaintext key material
anywhere.

What each group grades, and why it is written the way it is:

* **Acceptance 1 + 2 in ONE chain.** Provision through a real, non-test path and
  then read ``/.well-known/jwks.json`` over HTTP with the tenant's ``Host``. The
  ticket's two acceptance items are a single claim -- a key that is provisioned
  but not published is not usable, and a published key nobody can mint is not
  provisioned -- and no existing test connects them: both
  ``tests/integration/test_trust_root_documents.py`` and
  ``tests/e2e/test_trust_root_e2e.py`` seed the ROW with ``SigningKeyFactory``,
  never through production's mint. The fetch/kid helpers are IMPORTED from the A3
  suite rather than re-declared, because a second copy of ``_get_document`` is the
  duplication class the DRY invariant blocks PRs for.

* **The tenant is ROUTABLE, asserted before the act.** A tenant with no
  ``virtual_host``/``subdomain`` serves no JWKS at all, so the acceptance chain
  would fail (or, after a partial implementation, pass) for reasons that have
  nothing to do with provisioning. Every test that grades publication first reads
  the JWKS and asserts it answers 200 with an EMPTY key set -- which pins both
  that the host routes and that the tenant starts keyless, making the later
  appearance of the minted kid a real observed change.

* **Round trip through the full stack.** Provision (HTTP) -> read back (row) ->
  decrypt (production's resolver, using the deployment KEK) -> sign -> verify
  against the JWK the JWKS ENDPOINT served. A repository-level assertion that the
  row exists proves a sub-claim only; the acceptance's locus is what a
  counterparty can fetch and check.

* **No filesystem, asserted positively.** The design's storage decision is that
  the application writes key material to NO filesystem: the private PEM lives in
  the row, encrypted, as PKCS#8 ciphertext exactly as
  ``generate_signing_keypair(passphrase=...)`` returns it. "We stopped calling the
  writer" is not observable; a before/after snapshot of a sandboxed cwd + tempdir
  is.

* **The KEK gate refuses BEFORE key material exists.** Minting with no KEK
  configured would silently degrade "encrypted PEM in Postgres" into "private
  keys in the database". It must leave no row -- and, through the admin surface,
  must be a flash error and never
  a 5xx. A refusal carries no sentence of its own -- ``CODE_TABLE`` owns the
  buyer-facing text for ``CONFIGURATION_ERROR`` -- so the operator-actionable knob
  name travels in ``ConfigurationDetails.tracked_by`` and every assertion below
  reads the typed details (or the operator log) rather than ``str(exc)``.

* **The keyless wire, pinned but unchanged (acceptance 3).** ``TestKeylessWire``
  is EXPECTED TO PASS TODAY. It is not a red test: it guards the posture
  production already emits (``capabilities.py`` ``_build_signing_blocks``, whose
  values come from ``posture.py``'s ``agent_level_posture`` /
  ``webhook_signing_posture`` / ``emitted_identity``) so that D1
  (``salesagent-z6nr.20``) cannot switch a keyless tenant to silence without a
  test turning red. Silence is schema-legal and is exactly the dishonest
  declaration the epic's STRICT policy exists to prevent.

* **Revoke through the ROUTE, not through the repository.** ``revoke()`` and
  ``clear_signing_provider_cache()`` were both dark before this ticket, and the
  scan named the second one specifically: it is documented "for rotation tooling"
  and was called by nobody. Retirement is therefore graded end to end through the
  admin surface — the retired key stops signing the moment the route returns, and
  the published document carries its revocation marker for the grace window and
  then drops it. Selector-level grace arithmetic already lives in
  ``test_trust_root_documents.py`` and is not repeated here; what is graded here
  is the ROUTE causing it.

* **The dev KEK a fresh checkout supplies is all provisioning needs.**
  Minting refuses without a KEK, so a template that names no passphrase variable
  gives an operator a signing-keys page that can only fail. The two settings are
  read OUT of ``.env.template`` — the file ``cp .env.template .env`` produces and
  compose loads through ``env_file:`` — and then used as the only signing
  configuration in the process, so removing or renaming them there fails here
  rather than in someone's dev stack.

    caller. The admin route then ``flash()``es that PEM, and ``flash()`` writes to
    Flask's DEFAULT session store -- ``SecureCookieSessionInterface``, a
    CLIENT-SIDE cookie that is SIGNED BUT NOT ENCRYPTED, so its contents are
    readable by anyone holding the cookie. ``src/admin/app.py:128`` additionally
    sets ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=False`` in production so JavaScript can read
    it. The path an operator picks to keep private keys OUT of any store is the
    path that writes one into a browser cookie.

    The fix is not to stop flashing it. It is that provisioning has no private
    half to hand back: one mintable scheme, material encrypted on the row, and a

        an old page, a bookmarked form or a replayed request may still supply them.
        After this change they are inert: the route mints a ``db:`` key whose
        material stays on the row.

    it may never become SILENCE. A receiver cannot tell "this seller does not sign" from
