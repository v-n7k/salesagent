"""The seam returns ONE outcome record, decided by ONE match on the pinned scheme enum.

Epic D lane C4 (salesagent-fo99.4). The lane deletes the hand-rolled union — its
resolver and five variants, both aliases, and all fifteen ``isinstance`` sites —
and replaces the decision with ONE construction of the pinned library
``Authentication`` (imported as ``LibraryAuthentication``, an import alias rather
than a subclass) inside
``deliver_webhook``/``adeliver_webhook``, which hand every caller back a
:class:`WebhookDeliveryOutcome` instead of a decision object the caller could get
wrong. This file is that seam's contract, graded against a real origin and the
real transport.

THE RULE this file grades (owner rulings #1-#3, #5, #6), and where each half of
it comes from. INHERITED from the pinned library type (AdCP 3.1.1
``core/push-notification-config.json``): ``credentials`` required with
``minLength: 32``, ``schemes`` with ``minItems``/``maxItems`` 1, and the
``AuthenticationScheme`` enum ``["Bearer", "HMAC-SHA256"]``. ADDED by the
subclass, and nothing else: ``Literal["Basic"]`` widening the enum, and a
before-validator that folds casing.

    no scheme AND no credential               -> deliver PLAIN (the spec's own selector:
                                                 there was no authentication block)
    no scheme BUT a stored credential         -> REFUSE, reason ``no_scheme``
    Bearer,       creds >= 32              -> Authorization: Bearer
    HMAC-SHA256,  creds >= 32              -> sign those exact bytes
    anything the pinned type refuses       -> REFUSE, nothing dialled

There is ONE vocabulary: the pinned ``AuthenticationScheme``, case-sensitive,
exactly ``["Bearer", "HMAC-SHA256"]``. No ``Basic``, no case folding, no
seller-local superset.

That is a reversal, recorded here because the reversed reasoning is the more
tempting one and will be re-proposed. Earlier lanes widened the type: the A2A
``setTaskPushNotificationConfig`` handler stores
``params.authentication.scheme`` verbatim off a free-form protobuf string, so
``basic`` and ``hmac-sha256`` rows really do exist in production, and refusing
them stops deliveries whose owners are not on the phone to be asked. Every step
of that is still true. The owner ruled against it anyway: those rows are to be
MIGRATED, not tolerated — re-registered with a scheme and credentials the spec
defines — and until they are, they do not deliver.

The argument for tolerance is self-perpetuating, which is the point. It licenses
one member and one fold, and each is individually cheap; what it produced was
three spellings of one fact across three senders, disagreeing about which the
column held. A widening justified by "rows exist" can never expire, because rows
always exist. Refusing also fails visibly, in the operator's face, rather than
assembling an ``Authorization`` header from a scheme no registration validly
named and leaving the receiver unable to tell we guessed.

So a non-conforming stored row is graded below as ``refused_auth`` /
``scheme_not_in_spec``, and the log line naming the row is the migration surface.

Why zero hits is the discriminating assertion for a refusal, and not merely a
small number: the origin below is programmed to answer 200 and really is
listening. A destination that would have ACCEPTED the delivery is what makes "no
request arrived" mean *the seam refused* rather than *the request went out and
failed on arrival*. The same rationale is written at
``tests/integration/test_webhook_sender_auth_contract.py`` and
``test_order_approval_webhook.py::TestHmacSigning``.

Why integration and not BDD: the seam is not reached inside a request/response
cycle — every webhook sender runs after the buyer's call has already returned
(delivery scheduler, delivery poller, workflow-step status change), so there is
no wire envelope for a ``Then`` step to assert on. The identical rationale is
already recorded at ``tests/bdd/features/local-egress-ssrf-refusal.feature:45-51``.

This module was authored RED, before ``deliver_webhook`` existed: the seam then
exposed only a lower-level helper that took a ``secret`` the caller had resolved
for itself, and no outcome type at all. That lane has since landed, and the
helper it names was later folded into ``deliver_webhook`` itself. The two
seats that consume the outcome are graded
next door in ``tests/integration/test_webhook_refusal_reaches_both_seats.py``.
