"""A registration that asked for HMAC is DELIVERED signed — on every surface.

Epic D lane C2. ``tests/integration/test_webhook_sender_auth_contract.py``
already grades what a sender does with a STORED row, and
``tests/integration/test_webhook_hmac_credentials_ingest_refusal.py`` grades what
ingest does with an unusable registration. Between them sits the gap this file
grades: a registration that was accepted, and a sender that would have signed
it, still deliver UNSIGNED if the credential half is lost in the HANDOFF — the
workflow-step stash on the media-buy paths. Nothing on either side can see that,
because each end is individually correct.

Two producers reach that handoff; each gets a case, and each case gets a
reverse-TDD control that drops the credential half from the stash and shows the
delivery arrives unsigned. The control is what makes the primary case a grader
rather than a green mark: a case that cannot go red under the exact damage it
exists to detect is grading nothing, and this whole lane is a change to how
that handoff is represented.

Why the signature and not the stash's shape: the lane rewrites the intermediate
representation (raw dict / raw protobuf today, a validated value tomorrow), so
any assertion about the stash would have to be rewritten by the change it is
supposed to be guarding. What the buyer's endpoint receives is invariant across
that rewrite — and it is also the only thing a buyer can act on.

Why integration and not BDD: two of the three deliveries are fired by a
workflow-step status change and the third by a task reaching a terminal state,
both after the buyer's call has returned. There is no wire envelope for a
``Then`` step to assert on. The identical rationale is recorded at
``tests/integration/test_order_approval_webhook.py`` and
``tests/bdd/features/local-egress-ssrf-refusal.feature:45-51``.

MUST STAY GREEN untouched, and deliberately not modified here:
``tests/integration/test_webhook_sender_auth_contract.py``,
``tests/integration/test_order_approval_webhook.py``.

class TestBlankUrlRegistrationIsNotPersisted:
    """A whitespace-only URL must never become a stored config row.

    The obligation is stable across two lanes; only WHO refuses has changed, and
    each change made the answer stronger:

    - Lane C2 gave ``_impl`` a write guard keyed on ``registration.url.strip()``.
      That mattered because the registration gate is a documented no-op on blank
      URLs, so ``accept_push_notification_config`` RETURNS a value for
      ``url="   "``; keying the write on the value's PRESENCE persisted a row with
      a whitespace url (measured: ``('   ', 'HMAC-SHA256')``), and C2 also deleted
      the repository ValueError that used to catch it downstream.
    - Lane C3 then made the A2A tool wrapper coerce through the pinned model, so a
      whitespace url is now REFUSED at ingest — correctably, naming
      ``push_notification_config.url`` — instead of being silently dropped. The
      buyer learns their registration did not take effect, which is the whole
      point of the epic.

    The C2 write guard is GONE, and its removal is part of the same movement: with
    ``_impl`` typed, ``PushNotificationConfig(url="   ")`` raises ``url_parsing``,
    so a blank-url config cannot be constructed and the guard became unreachable
    code. The protection did not disappear — it moved into the type, and this case
    grades it at the wrapper, which is why it asserts a REFUSAL as well as the
    absent row rather than only the absent row.

    WHICH code, and why the refusal is graded on the wire and not on an exception
    class. ``   `` fails the pinned ``core/push-notification-config.json``
    (AdCP 3.1.1) constraint on ``url`` — ``"type": "string", "format": "uri"`` —
    which is a SCHEMA violation, and ``enums/error-code.json`` splits exactly
    there: ``INVALID_REQUEST`` is "malformed, missing required fields, or violates
    schema constraints", ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` is "violates business rules beyond
    schema validation". So the code is ``INVALID_REQUEST`` with
    ``recovery: "correctable"``, and ``core/error.json``'s ``field`` — "field path
    associated with the error in JSONPath-lite format" — must name
    ``push_notification_config.url`` so the buyer knows WHAT to fix. Both halves
    are asserted, because a refusal that does not name the field degrades the
    buyer to "invalid request" with nowhere to go even though the request was
    correctly rejected.

    The assertion goes through ``TransportResult.assert_wire_error`` on the
    envelope the buyer actually received, not ``pytest.raises`` on a production
    exception class: the harness no longer reconstructs ``AdCPSalesAgentError``
    subclasses from wire bytes (``tests/harness/_base.py`` ``WireError``), so a
    class assertion here would grade a reconstruction that no longer exists.
