"""Integration tests for the Postgres-backed RFC 9421 replay store (A4, #1291).

The production surface these tests grade:

* ``adcp_replay`` table + ``src.core.database.models.ReplayNonce``
* ``src.core.database.repositories.replay_nonce.ReplayNonceRepository``
* ``src.core.signing.replay_store.PostgresReplayStore``
* ``src.core.config.SigningSettings`` (the replay knobs: ``per_keyid_cap``,
  ``per_keyid_cap_overrides``, ``replay_ttl_overrides``, ``replay_claim_ttl_seconds``)

Spec grounding — AdCP 3.1.1 via ``adcp==6.6.0``:
``dist/compliance/3.1.1/test-kits/signed-requests-runner.yaml`` (stateful contract:
``min_replay_ttl_seconds: 10``, ``max_interval_seconds: 5``, ``window_seconds: 60``,
``grading_target_per_keyid_cap_requests: 100``,
``production_min_per_keyid_cap_requests: 1000000``), graded at the wire by vectors
``016-replayed-nonce`` (``request_signature_replayed``) and ``020-rate-abuse``
(``request_signature_rate_abuse``).

**Level: integration, deliberately.** A4 is infrastructure BELOW the wire. The wire
grading of 016/020 belongs to B3 (salesagent-z6nr.14) and the ``signed-requests``
storyboard — these tests must not duplicate it. This project writes no unit tests.

Test-data note: every test mints a unique ``keyid`` (``a4-<uuid>``), so tests never
collide and no cleanup is required — rows self-expire and every read the store does
filters ``expires_at > now()``. No factory exists (or is needed) for ``adcp_replay``:
the production store is what writes the rows, which is the point.

That is also why these tests take a plain ``Session`` fixture instead of an
``IntegrationEnv`` subclass (the ``_RepoEnv`` shape in
``tests/integration/test_account_repository.py``). The env's job is binding factories
to a session and patching external services; this module seeds no factory data and
patches nothing, so all it would contribute is a global factory-session binding and
its no-nesting assertion — both pure hazard in a test that runs eight threads. The
session is built exactly the way the env builds its own (``tests/harness/_base.py``
binds ``Session(bind=get_engine())``); a test body may not call ``get_db_session()``
(``test_architecture_repository_pattern.py`` invariant 3) and this module does not.

        This is the whole point of A4. The SDK's own ``PgReplayStore`` does a bare

        ``remember()`` (``adcp/signing/pg/replay_store.py:215,221``) — a read-then-write
        race in which two workers both observe "not seen" and both accept the same
        nonce. Its docstring's "Postgres provides the cross-instance locking" claim is
        false for the PAIR: conflict resolution protects the write, not the check.

        Each thread opens its OWN session, which really is its own connection:
        ``scoped_session`` at ``src/core/database/database_session.py:151`` takes no
        ``scopefunc``, so registries are thread-local (exemplar:

        sessions to the same engine directly, as the harness itself does).

        is a few hundred microseconds, so a single red run proves nothing — the mutant
        must fail in **>= 15 of the 20 iterations** below (or the mutant must be widened
        with a deliberate sleep between its SELECT and its INSERT). Paste that run's

        """An overridden keyid's row does not outlive its override; an unoverridden one does.

        ``remember()`` is handed ``ttl = max(expires - now + max_skew, 0)`` computed
        from the SIGNATURE (``verifier.py:354``), and its only-extend predicate raises
        any shorter claim to that value. Both runner vectors carry a 300s window, so
        without a clamp every accepted request for ``test-ed25519-2026`` leaves a row
        live ~360s — 6x the test-kit's ``window_seconds: 60``. Vector 020 drives that
        keyid to its cap of 100, and those rows then trip step 9a for every LATER
        vector, including 016's first (must-be-accepted) submission. The suite would
        only pass if the grader happened to run 020 last, which
        ``signed-requests-runner.yaml`` does not specify.

        70s is the value that satisfies every side at once: ``>= min_replay_ttl_seconds``
        (10) and ``> max_interval_seconds`` (5) so 016 still grades and cannot
        false-green, ``>= window_seconds`` (60) so 020 still reaches the cap, and short
        enough that the cap drains between vectors.
