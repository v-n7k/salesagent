"""Integration tests pinning salesagent-z6nr.12 (#1291 B1) — the ONE inbound
RFC 9421 request-signature verifier.

THE SUBJECT MOVED, THE OBLIGATIONS DID NOT. #1291 wrote the verifier as a fourth
ASGI middleware (``src.core.signing.request_verifier_middleware``) that read the
``Signature`` headers, resolved its own tenant and its own principal, and sent its
own 401. On #1721's request boundary there is exactly one reader of a credential,
so the verifier became a call that reader makes:
:func:`src.core.signing.verifier.verify_inbound_signature`, invoked by
``_resolve_identity`` (``src/core/resolved_identity.py``, step 4b) with the tenant
and the principal it has already resolved, and the operation the boundary
dispatched on. A refusal is a typed ``AdCPRequestSignatureError`` carrying the
specific taxonomy code; ``AuthChallengeResponder`` (``src/core/auth_middleware.py``)
is the one renderer that lifts it to 401 with
``WWW-Authenticate: Signature error="<code>"``.

Every test below therefore still drives a REAL request through the REAL app and
reads the REAL wire — what changed is which production names the comments point
at, and that ``/api/v1/capabilities`` is POST-only now (the GET shape was deleted
with the registry-derived routes, ``src/core/tools/registry.py`` ``RestBinding``).

What is graded here, and why each one exists
--------------------------------------------

**R-H1 — the composition rule (production-breaking if wrong).**
``required_for`` governs the signature requirement *relative to the caller's
credential path*, not absolutely. Pinned spec (AdCP 3.1.1 →
``docs/building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx`` in
``github.com/adcontextprotocol/adcp`` @ tag ``v3.1.1``):

  :1268  an **unauthenticated** request to a ``required_for`` operation MUST be
         rejected with ``request_signature_required``;
  :1269  an **unsigned but otherwise authenticated** request (valid bearer, no
         ``Signature-Input``) MUST NOT be rejected for the missing signature;
  :1271  a **malformed signature** blocks that fallback regardless;
  :1224  states it as a three-way AND ("…AND the caller presents no other
         credential the verifier accepts");
  :1289  names this exact failure — "a seller enabling ``required_for`` for
         operational monitoring would inadvertently 401 every bearer-authed
         buyer".

Salesagent is bearer-authenticated on every AdCP request, so the naive reading
401s essentially all production traffic the moment D1 populates
``required_for``. Compliance negative vector 001 does NOT catch this: its
request carries only ``Content-Type``, i.e. it is unauthenticated, and is
therefore consistent with BOTH readings. All three branches are pinned below.

The UNAUTHENTICATED branch is realized by sending NO ``Authorization`` header,
which is what the spec's "presents no other credential" means and what negative
vector 001 sends. A bogus bearer is a different case on this architecture and is
graded elsewhere: ``_resolve_identity`` refuses a PRESENTED-and-rejected token
with ``AUTH_INVALID`` on every row, ahead of step 4b, so a signature can never
launder a rejected token — that ordering is stated in the resolver and is not
this module's obligation.

**R-H2 / R-M5(b) — the verifier verifies the WIRE bytes and the as-received
target URI.** The original collision is structurally absent here: ``#1291``
placed the verifier beside ``RestCompatMiddleware``
(``src/routes/rest_compat_middleware.py``), which rewrote ``request._body`` for
POST ``/api/v1/{products,media-buys,creatives/sync}``, so the middleware ORDER
decided whether the verifier hashed bytes the signer never signed. Both that
middleware and ``src/core/request_compat.py`` are DELETED on this architecture —
nothing rewrites a request body between the socket and the signature subject.
What replaces the ordering constraint is a recorder that decides nothing:
``SignedExchangeCapture`` (``src/core/signing/capture.py``) stashes the exact
bytes as read, the method, and a ``@target-uri`` rebuilt from ``raw_path``,
because ``_resolve_identity`` runs far behind the socket and cannot rebuild
either. :class:`TestTheVerifierIsHandedTheWireBytes` grades the end-to-end
consequence on ``/api/v1/media-buys`` = ``create_media_buy``, the spend-committing
operation the spec pushes toward ``covers_content_digest: "required"``: the SDK
is handed the bytes that were sent and the URL that was received, and the
signature verifies. The capture's own two obligations — record faithfully, and
replay the channel it drained — are graded at
``tests/unit/test_signed_exchange_capture.py``.

**R-H3 — the ``none`` bucket costs nothing.** Two junk signature headers under
``supported: false`` must not run crypto. Asserted observably (the SDK verifier
is never invoked; the downstream handler still receives the full body), not by
reading the verifier's source.

**R-L / three-way pre-check.** Both headers absent → composition rule; exactly
one present → ``_precheck_presence`` raises (``adcp/signing/verifier.py:389``);
both present → verify.

**The bucket ladder.** ``supported_for`` / ``required_for``
differ on the WIRE from the narrowed ``none`` bucket (401 vs 200), not merely in
a counter — status AND counter are asserted.

**B4 — the configured counterparty registry (``salesagent-z6nr.15``).** The
second, config-sourced way a keyid resolves to key material, added because the
conformance runner sends no bearer and therefore produces no principal-derived
``agent_url`` to walk. It is a key-trust bypass unless two things hold, and the
last three classes in this module hold them: the registry is consulted ONLY when
that walk has no INPUT — never when the walk merely FAILED, which would let a
counterparty with a briefly unreachable brand.json be silently re-identified from
config — and the configuration is refused at ``SigningSettings`` construction
under every production signal this codebase deploys under. See the block comment
above :data:`_PRODUCTION_SIGNALS` for the spec grounding and the full argument.

Why these tests are not vacuous
-------------------------------

The seam is the tenant DECLARATION, never the verifier's decision function:
:func:`_declared_posture` STORES a real ``request_signing`` declaration through
the repository and lets production do the rest — ``CapabilityDeclarations
.from_tenant`` parses it, ``posture_for_tenant`` reads it off the loaded
``TenantContext``, and the REAL ``RequestSigningPosture.bucket_for`` precedence
(``required_for > supported_for``) runs. #1291 D1 took
``request_signing`` out of ``_UNBACKED_BLOCKS``
(``src/core/schemas/capability_declarations.py``), which is what makes a stored
declaration reachable at all; there is no ``patch`` of the posture left anywhere
in this ladder.

The OPERATION these declarations bucket is the registry key the boundary
dispatched on (``src/core/tools/registry.py``), not a name re-derived from the
body, so :data:`LADDER_OPERATIONS` carries the real AdCP operation names this
ladder invokes — which is what makes every assertion below non-vacuous.

Covers: salesagent-z6nr.12 (Core Invariant + Refinement R-H1, R-H2, R-H3,
R-L, and the shadow-mode ladder); salesagent-z6nr.15 (Core Invariant —
registry-as-fallback precedence and the production refusal).

# (salesagent-nx8jp.9). They moved for the reason the import block above gives: a
# realization whose home is a test module cannot be reached by the harness at all
# (``test_architecture_no_cross_test_module_imports``), so
# ``declare_request_signing(bucket="narrowed_none")`` could only have been served by a
# THIRD copy. There were already two.


#: The bucket dimension of the malformed-signature rule (security.mdx :1226/:1271),
#: as FOUR rows rather than three.
#:
#: :1226 scopes the rule by the ABSENCE of a bucket — "Verifiers MUST NOT fall back to
#: bearer-only authentication when a malformed signature is present, **even for
#: operations not in required_for**" — so a test that pins one bucket grades a
#: bucket-independent rule at a single point and reports green for the three points it
#: never visited. Each row below names which point it is:
#:
#: * ``required``          — the point the un-parametrized test already stood on;
#: * ``narrowed-none``     — ``supported: true`` and the operation in no list. This is
#:   the population :1226's "even for operations not in required_for" names most
#:   directly;
#: * ``unsupported-none``  — ``supported: false``. NOT covered by the rule: the seller
#:   advertises that it verifies nothing, and the storyboard gates its negatives on
#:   ``supported: true``. Its 200 is the CONTROL, and it must stay 200 forever — a row
#:   that expected 401 here would be a permanent red demanding a conformance break.

    * **step 7, ``key_unknown`` — ENGINEERED.** This bucket hands the checklist an empty
      key set BY CONSTRUCTION (design §C: no counterparty resolution, so
      ``StaticJwksResolver({})``), and ``adcp/signing/verifier.py:259`` raises
      ``request_signature_key_unknown`` the moment it is consulted. §C2: there is no
      success exit before that point, so EVERY well-formed narrowed-``none`` signature
      lands here. Counting those as ``signature_failed`` would put a self-inflicted
      failure in the same series as a real key-resolution failure, at the rate of the
      seller's whole un-narrowed traffic — so the failure is suppressed and the
      pass-through is counted as what it is, ``ignored``.
    * **step 1, ``header_malformed`` — GENUINE.** Nothing about this bucket engineered
      it: the caller sent a broken header, and this is precisely the request
      security.mdx :1226 stops from falling back to bearer. It is rejected, and because
      the rejection returns before the pass-through arm, a suppression written as the
      bare "the bucket is not none" would record NOTHING AT ALL for it — a 401 that no
      counter anywhere can see.

    WHAT #1291 GRADED HERE, AND WHY IT MOVED. On the middleware architecture the

    one shape of traffic. On #1721 the verifier is not ahead of the route — it is behind
    ``validated_request``, inside ``_resolve_identity``, and ``serve``
    (``src/core/tools/_boundary.py``) parses the payload BEFORE ``invoke_tool`` resolves
    an identity. A body that never finished arriving cannot parse, so this request is

    """A signature covers bytes and a ``@target-uri``; both must survive to the SDK.

    #1291 stated this as a middleware ORDERING constraint, because
    ``RestCompatMiddleware`` (``src/routes/rest_compat_middleware.py``) replaced
    ``request._body`` with normalized JSON for POST ``/api/v1/{products,media-buys,
    creatives/sync}``, and a verifier registered inside it hashed bytes the signer
    never signed — ``request_signature_digest_mismatch`` on ``create_media_buy``, the
    spend-committing operation.

    That module and ``src/core/request_compat.py`` are DELETED here, so the collision
    is structurally absent rather than merely avoided: nothing rewrites a request body
    between the socket and the signature subject. The ordering constraint is replaced by
    a DISTANCE one, and it is no weaker — ``_resolve_identity`` runs deep behind the
    socket, long after the body has been read and the scope's ``raw_path`` is the only
    remaining record of the target URI, so what the SDK is handed comes from
    ``SignedExchangeCapture`` (``src/core/signing/capture.py``) and from nowhere else.
    This class grades the end-to-end consequence on the same spend-committing route:
    the bytes the SDK verified are the bytes that were sent, the URL it verified against
    is the URL that was received, and the signature verifies.

    ``tests/unit/test_signed_exchange_capture.py`` grades the capture's own two

# B4 — the configured counterparty registry (salesagent-z6nr.15)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY the registry exists at all: the @adcp/sdk conformance runner sends NO bearer
# (verified across the vendored vector set — only negative/027 carries an
# Authorization header, and that one is deliberately unsigned). Our verifier derives
# the counterparty from the AUTHENTICATED principal, so with no bearer there is no
# ``Principal.agent_url``, no brand.json to walk, and every positive vector reaches
# ``request_signature_key_unknown`` at step 7. AdCP 3.1.1 ``security.mdx`` :1090
# gives the fallback its cover — "Discovery MAY come from prior onboarding, MAY come
# from a registry cache" — and :1236 requires only that the keyid resolve to a
# specific ``agents[]`` entry, which a config-seeded resolution does.
#
# WHY it is dangerous, and what these tests hold in place: a keyid -> counterparty
# map is a key-trust bypass the moment it can either (1) outrank a real
# counterparty's onboarding record, or (2) be configured in production. So the
# invariant has two halves and both are graded here — the registry is a FALLBACK
# consulted solely when the principal-derived walk has no INPUT (never when that
# walk merely FAILED), and the configuration is refused at ``SigningSettings``
# construction under every production signal this codebase deploys under.

#: The signals this codebase already treats as "this is production", each read at a
#: different site: ``ENVIRONMENT`` by ``src.core.config.is_production``, ``PRODUCTION``
#: and ``ENVIRONMENT`` together by ``src.admin.utils.helpers.is_admin_production``, and
#: ``FLY_APP_NAME`` (or ``PRODUCTION``) by ``scripts/run_server.py``. Named here rather
#: than imported from the production predicate on purpose: a test that asks the guard
#: which signals it honors cannot notice a signal the guard forgot.
