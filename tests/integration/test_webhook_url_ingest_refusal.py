"""Ingest-time egress refusal of buyer-supplied webhook URLs, on the wire.

A buyer-supplied ``push_notification_config.url`` / ``reporting_webhook.url``
is a URL we STORE now and FETCH later — an SSRF vector the egress seam
(``src/core/security/outbound_http.py``) refuses at delivery time. But the
buyer supplied it at ingest, on a request/response cycle where a correctable
refusal is still possible. Accepting the URL with a 'success' and failing the
delivery silently later gives the buyer no channel to learn the URL is wrong
(GH #1697; the same obligation GH #1589 implemented for
``property_list.agent_url``, the other buyer-supplied URL on the protocol
surface — exemplar: ``tests/integration/test_property_list_resolver.py``
``TestRefusedBuyerUrlOnTheWire``).

What this pins, per ingest surface (create_media_buy, update_media_buy,
sync_creatives) with both egress escape hatches CLOSED:

* the request FAILS at ingest (no 'success' followed by a silent delivery
  failure), and
* the wire envelope is ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` / ``correctable`` with
  ``error.field`` naming exactly which buyer input to fix and the buyer-facing
  ``suggestion`` that code resolves to — all graded on BOTH envelope layers.
  Every surface refuses through the one registration-time SSRF gate
  (``reject_unsafe_webhook_registration_url``, which raises
  ``AdCPUrlNotAllowedError``); see ``_REGISTRATION_GATE_CODE`` below, and
* the envelope says NOTHING about our network: neither the refused URL, nor its
  host, nor the buyer's own supplied secret reaches any buyer-facing field.
  Under ADR-010 the refusal is assembled from the code alone, so this is the
  property that has to hold rather than be hoped for, and
* the refused config leaves NO side effect (no persisted
  push_notification_config row; no creative synced) — the refusal happens
  BEFORE the storage points, not per-item inside them.

Spec grounding — AdCP 3.1.1, the version this repo PINS (``adcp==6.6.0``,
``docs/adcp-spec-version.md``; prose via ``git -C <adcp-checkout> show
v3.1.1:<path>``):

1. ``docs/building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx`` § "Webhook URL validation
   (SSRF)": "Any URL that a buyer, seller, or governance agent provides for
   another party to fetch is an SSRF vector." Points 1 (reject non-HTTPS) and
   2 (reject reserved-range addresses; 169.254.169.254 named outright)
   prescribe the refusal; point 6 prescribes the silence about our network —
   which leaves ``error.field`` as the only channel naming WHICH input to fix.
2. ``docs/building/by-layer/L3/error-handling.mdx`` § "Request Validation"
   (``VALIDATION_ERROR | correctable``) + § "Recovery Classification": a URL
   egress policy refuses identically forever, so ``transient`` would promise
   something false. ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` is the code the registration gate
   emits, and it is independently pinned for the sync_creatives leg by
   ``tests/bdd/features/BR-UC-006-sync-creatives.feature``
   ``@T-UC-006-ext-webhook-ssrf`` (``VALIDATION_ERROR`` + ``correctable`` +
   ``suggestion``, carrying an ``@source repo=adcp ref=v3.1.1`` citation on
   ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/enums/error-code.json``).
3. ``push_notification_config`` is a TOP-LEVEL property of
   ``dist/schemas/3.1.1/media-buy/create-media-buy-request.json`` (``$ref``
   ``core/push-notification-config.json``, required ``["url"]``); same
   top-level shape in ``update-media-buy-request.json`` and
   ``creative/sync-creatives-request.json``; ``reporting_webhook`` likewise
   top-level on create/update. Hence the field paths are
   ``push_notification_config.url`` / ``reporting_webhook.url``.

Conformance storyboard: UNGRADED — nothing in ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/``
grades a seller refusing a counterparty-supplied URL (same finding recorded
for GH #1589).

No acceptance-path twin lives here on purpose: the ~38 existing suites that
pass ``push_notification_config`` fixtures through these same surfaces are the
acceptance coverage, and migrating their hatch-immune NXDOMAIN fixture hosts
is budgeted as its own step of the GH #1697 plan (step 0) — grading
acceptance here against a resolvable host would re-decide that fixture policy
in a second place.

        ``media-buy/update-media-buy-request.json`` lists 16 properties and
        budget is not among them (``UpdateMediaBuyRequest`` says so at its own
        declaration site), so the model refuses it as an extra input. Expressing
        it as ``packages[].budget`` is the same intent in the spelling the
        schema defines, against the package the fixture actually seeded — so the
        update still carries a REAL mutation and the refusal is not passing
        merely because there was nothing to update.

        ``account`` and ``idempotency_key`` are required by the same pinned
        request, and are supplied for the reason ``_REFUSED_REPORTING_WEBHOOK``
        is schema-valid: the request must be valid AS A DOCUMENT so the ONLY
        possible rejection is the egress refusal. A per-test unique key, because
        the pinned shape is 16-255 characters and a fixed one would make two
        cases in this class collide on idempotency.

    workflow request_data. Today the sync accepts it and returns success.
