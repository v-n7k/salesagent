"""Integration tests: async creative lifecycle obligation coverage.

Exercises the async lifecycle states (submitted, working, input_required) through
_sync_creatives_impl using CreativeSyncEnv with real PostgreSQL.

These obligations test that the creative sync workflow produces states that map
to the AdCP async lifecycle protocol:
- submitted: creative queued for human review (approval_mode=require-human)
- working: creative being processed by AI reviewer (approval_mode=ai-powered)
- input_required: creative needs buyer input before it can proceed

Each test creates a real creative through the impl, verifies the DB state,
then validates the AdCP async schema type can represent that state.
