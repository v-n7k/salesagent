"""Order-approval notifications must be authenticated the way the buyer registered.

A buyer registers ONE ``PushNotificationConfig`` row (tenant + principal + url +
``authentication_type``). Every AdCP webhook sender now reads that row through the
SAME seam, ``src/core/security/webhook_egress.py``: ``_authentication_or_refusal``
validates the stored pair into a ``PushAuthentication``, ``_headers_for`` matches it
to exactly one of three arms (legacy HMAC-SHA256, Bearer, and the RFC 9421 profile
that the ABSENCE of an ``authentication`` block selects), and
``prepare_signed_request`` serializes the payload ONCE and hands those exact bytes
to ``send``'s ``content=``.

The fourth sender, ``src/services/order_approval_service.py:_send_approval_webhook``,
used to read the same row and handle only ``bearer``/``basic`` — so the
``order_approval_update`` notification arrived with no signature at all, while the
identical registration produced signed deliveries elsewhere (salesagent-98t2). It
now dials ``deliver_webhook`` like the other three (GH #1802), and these two tests
are that fix's regression grade. They drive the real outbound request rather than
calling the seam directly, because the defect was never in the seam — it was in
which sender reached one.

The two tests grade two distinct defects through the same outbound request:

1. ``test_hmac_receiver_gets_a_signed_approval_notification`` — the
   authentication gap. The registered ``HMAC-SHA256`` selector must produce the
   pair the legacy fallback is defined to emit: ``X-AdCP-Signature: sha256=<hex>``
   over ``{unix_timestamp}.{raw_body_bytes}``, plus ``X-AdCP-Timestamp``. Pinned
   AdCP 3.1.1, ``docs/building/by-layer/L3/webhooks.mdx:404-418``;
   ``adcp.sign_legacy_webhook`` (adcp==6.6.0), which ``prepare_signed_request``
   calls, implements exactly that and is the cross-check, not the authority.

2. ``test_non_ascii_approval_notification_is_signed_over_the_bytes_sent`` — the
   re-serialization. The old sender POSTed ``json=payload`` rather than the bytes
   the signature was computed over. Measured fact about the pinned httpx (0.28.1):
   its ``encode_json`` already emits ``separators=(",", ":")`` with
   ``ensure_ascii=False``, so for an ASCII payload ``json=`` and ``content=``
   produce IDENTICAL bytes and an ASCII test proves nothing. The signing core
   serializes with the default ``ensure_ascii=True``, so only a payload carrying a
   NON-ASCII value distinguishes "signed the dict" from "sent the signed bytes".
   That is what the accented/CJK advertiser name below is for — it is what makes
   the byte-identity assertion able to fail, not decoration. (The success payload
   has no free-text field: ``message`` is the constant "Order approved
   successfully". The ad server's own rejection text is the one place a
   buyer-visible non-ASCII string enters this payload, which is why test 2 drives
   the FAILURE path.)

Test 2 also covers a THIRD defect this reproduction uncovered, since fixed:
``_mark_approval_failed`` committed inside ``with get_db_session()`` — which
EXPIRES the ``SyncJob`` — then read ``approval_job.progress`` after the session had
closed. That raised ``DetachedInstanceError``, the blanket ``except`` swallowed it,
and the buyer was never told the order had failed at all. The progress fields are
now read before that block ends, and the comment at the fix names this file as its
regression test. The ``len(captured) == 1`` leg is what grades it, which is why it
is asserted before any header assertion: "no webhook" and "an unsigned webhook" are
different defects.

Scope: this fixture seeds no signing key, so ``delivery_signer_for_tenant`` answers
the decided ``None`` posture and the RFC 9421 arm is never taken here. The ABSENCE
of a ``Signature`` header is therefore NOT asserted below — on this fixture it would
grade nothing. "Never signed both ways" (pinned AdCP 3.1.1,
``docs/building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx:1425``) is a property of ``_headers_for``'s
three-slot return, and is graded where a signer actually exists.

Both tests assert on the real outbound request, captured by the shared
``tests.helpers.webhook_wire.capture_outbound_webhooks`` (one capture for every
AdCP sender, so C1's suite and this one cannot drift into two): the network is
the only thing stubbed, so the headers and ``.content`` are exactly what the
client would have put on the socket. GAM is mocked at the adapter boundary — it
is a true external.

NOTE (plumbing gap — the stated prerequisite is now MET, the migration is not):
this used to record that the shared e2e receiver discarded headers and raw body
bytes, so it could not grade either defect. Two receivers now can:
``tests/e2e/_webhook_capture.py``'s ``record_raw`` (#1291 C1) and the
TLS-fronted ``tests/e2e/webhook_capture_service.py`` (salesagent-mp53.9), which
stores ``{path, headers, body_b64}`` per delivery.

So the blocker on moving this coverage onto a real socket is gone; the move
itself is tracked as salesagent-og9k.12 and deliberately NOT smuggled in here.
Leaving the old claim in place would have invited the next author to re-derive a
bespoke capture that already exists twice over.
