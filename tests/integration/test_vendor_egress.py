"""Vendor and operator egress, driven at a REAL local origin — the retry-drift gate.

#1589 migrates the ten remaining operator-configured call sites onto
``src/core/security/outbound_http.py``. The seam decides address policy, TLS
policy, redirect refusal, the response-size cap, the attempt count and the
backoff schedule, and it grades all six exactly once, in
``tests/integration/test_outbound_http.py``. Re-asserting any of them here would
be the duplication the seam exists to delete.

What this file grades is the one property the seam CANNOT decide for a call
site: **how many times the site is willing to hit the origin**. The seam takes
``max_attempts`` as an argument, so a migration that passes the wrong number —
or that leaves a second attempt-count wrapped around the method, where neither
the ``ruff-egress.toml`` import bans nor ``test_architecture_no_call_site_backoff``
can see it — turns one failed campaign create into three. Campaign, flight and
creative creation are POSTs; they are not idempotent; a buyer pays for the
duplicates.

So every case here points a real production method at a real HTTP server that
really ran, programs it to fail, and asserts on ``local_origin.hits`` — the
count of requests the server actually received. A transport mock's
``call_count`` cannot make that claim: it counts calls the test itself
arranged, on a code path the client never walked.

The private-range egress escape hatch is opened explicitly (``allow_local_origin``)
because a local origin is loopback, which the seam refuses by default and
rightly so; it is a no-op before the migration (``requests`` has no address
policy) and load-bearing after it, so the cases read identically on both sides
of the change. The origin itself is served over real TLS (``local_origin_tls``,
salesagent-e6h0) since the seam requires https unconditionally now — there is
no scheme hatch left to open.

Two of the ten sites had no origin-driven case here, and that was a finding
rather than a gap: a host spelled as a literal at its call site leaves a test
nothing to point anywhere. Both have since been hoisted to a module-level
constant in the services layer, so the gates they blocked are writable:

* ``src/admin/blueprints/settings.py``'s four Approximated calls became one
  ``APPROXIMATED_BASE_URL`` in ``src/services/approximated_client.py``
  (salesagent-47n9.7). Still no origin-driven case here — the affordance
  exists, the happy paths remain to be written.
* ``src/admin/blueprints/auth.py``'s token exchange became
  ``GOOGLE_TOKEN_URL`` in ``src/services/google_oauth_client.py``
  (salesagent-6gpt.4), which is what lets the Google cases below drive real
  production code — service and ``gam_callback`` alike — at a real origin.

The injectability cases in section 3 pin both constants in place. They were the
red that unblocked the gates, and they stay as the regression that would name
the cause if either host were ever inlined back into a call site.
