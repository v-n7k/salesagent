"""An unreachable creative agent must not leak its raw failure text into the
SUCCESS payload's ``errors[]``.

The sibling obligation to ``tests/integration/test_typed_error_wire_safety.py``,
on the OTHER buyer-facing error carrier. ``list_creative_formats`` degrades
gracefully: one unreachable agent does not fail the request, it produces an
``AGENT_UNREACHABLE`` entry in ``errors[]`` on an otherwise successful response
(``src/core/creative_agent_registry.py`` ``list_all_formats_with_errors``).
Because the response is a success, ``result.is_error`` is False and
``wire_error_envelope`` is ``None`` — the two-layer envelope helpers cannot
grade this path at all, which is why it needs its own assertion surface
(``assert_no_marker_in_payload_errors``).

The carrier is in scope for the same MUST NOT list as the envelope:

* AdCP 3.1.1 ``dist/docs/3.1.1/building/operating/transport-errors.mdx``
  § Security Considerations / Seller Requirements (lines 659-670) opens with
  "Error responses flow through LLM context. Every field is client-facing" and
  forbids internal service names/hostnames/IP addresses and upstream API
  responses.
* ``dist/compliance/3.1.1/universal/error-compliance.yaml`` (:323) grades a
  typed error code "via either ``adcp_error`` (envelope) or ``errors[]``
  (payload)" — the two carriers have equal status. That step validates the
  CODE only, so the message-content obligation asserted here is ungraded by the
  storyboard and rests on the normative prose above.

The construction site fixed here interpolated BOTH the caught exception and the
seller-configured ``agent.agent_url``::

    message=f"Creative agent at {agent.agent_url} is unreachable: {e}"

Both are dropped. The raw cause is still captured server-side by the existing
``logger.error(..., exc_info=True)`` one line above it — ``adcp.types.Error`` is
an SDK model, so it has no ``internal_detail`` slot to route it through.

    * ``_get_tenant_agents`` — supplies the seller-configured agent, because
      there is no tenant row for one.
    * ``_fetch_formats_operator`` — the DEEPEST production method on the
      operator dial, so ``get_formats_for_agent`` (provenance branch, testing
      short-circuit, cache) and ``list_all_formats_with_errors`` (the
      ``except`` branch this module grades) both run for real.

    The fetch method used to be ``_fetch_formats_from_agent``, patched alongside
    a ``_build_adcp_client``. Neither name exists any more: the egress-seam
    migration renamed the operator dial to ``_fetch_formats_operator`` and
    deleted the SDK-client builder outright in favour of
    ``call_operator_mcp_tool``, whose httpx stack egress policy can reach
    (adcp 6.6.0 exposes no transport knob — adcp-client-python#1004). Patching a
    name that no longer exists is what the re-point fixes; the injected fault and
    everything asserted about it are unchanged.

    The sibling above covers the seller-aggregation branch: nobody asked for that
    agent, it merely failed while the seller was collecting its catalog, and the
    buyer gets the transient AGENT_UNREACHABLE advisory.

    This is the other branch, and the pinned spec is explicit about it --
    ``dist/docs/3.1.0/creative/task-reference/list_creative_formats.mdx:654``:

        REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND | Requested format_id doesn't exist, or referenced
        creative agent is unavailable / not accessible. error.field MUST
        identify which typed parameter failed to resolve.

    So when ``req.format_ids`` names this agent, the code changes AND
    ``error.field`` moves from "formats" (the response section the advisory
    degrades) to "format_ids" (the typed parameter that failed to resolve --
    the MUST).

    RECOVERY IS THE BUYER-VISIBLE CONSEQUENCE, and is why the two branches must
    not be collapsed: AGENT_UNREACHABLE is transient, so a buyer is told to
    retry; REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND is correctable, so it is told to fix the
    reference. Retrying the same format_ids against a down agent never succeeds,
    which is exactly the wrong advice the undifferentiated advisory gave.
