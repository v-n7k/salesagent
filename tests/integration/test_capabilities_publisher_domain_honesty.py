"""salesagent-piyo — get_adcp_capabilities must not fabricate a publisher domain.

Core Invariant under test: ``portfolio.publisher_domains`` is a CLAIM the seller
makes about which publishers' inventory it represents. A buyer resolves that claim
against each publisher's ``/.well-known/adagents.json`` (dist/schemas/3.1.1/adagents.json
@ v3.1.1). Inventing a domain the tenant has no partnership with asserts an
authorization no publisher granted -- the same class of dishonesty the STRICT
declaration policy exists to prevent.

The regression this guards: ``_get_adcp_capabilities_impl`` in
``src/core/tools/capabilities.py`` used to substitute ``f"{subdomain}.example.com"``
whenever no ``PublisherPartner`` row existed. ``example.com`` is RFC 2606 reserved,
so the fabricated value is guaranteed unreachable -- it can never host a real
``adagents.json``.

Per the pinned v3.1.1 schema (bundled ``protocol/get-adcp-capabilities-response.json``):
``media_buy.portfolio.publisher_domains`` is REQUIRED with ``minItems: 1`` when
``portfolio`` is present, but ``media_buy.portfolio`` itself is OPTIONAL (media_buy
has no ``required`` list). A portfolio with zero real domains is therefore
schema-INVALID to emit; the only spec-legal response when a tenant has no publisher
partnership is to OMIT ``portfolio`` entirely, not to fabricate a domain and not to
emit an empty ``publisher_domains`` array.

This landed TDD RED against the pre-fix production and is GREEN here: the merged
``_get_adcp_capabilities_impl`` builds a ``Portfolio`` only ``if publisher_domains``
and returns ``None`` otherwise.
