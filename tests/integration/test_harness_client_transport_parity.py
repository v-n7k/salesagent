"""Transport parity for AdCPTestClient, against a real database.

Lives in tests/integration/ rather than beside the rest of the client's tests in
tests/harness/test_client.py because these two need PostgreSQL: they drive REST
dispatch through get_rest_client() and seed real rows via the ORM factories.

tox's `unit` env collects `tests/unit/ tests/harness/` with DATABASE_URL unset --
"no database, no server", as its own description says -- so a db-requiring test
under tests/harness/ fails at fixture setup with a connection refusal, and no
other env collects that directory to catch it. Keeping the split by directory,
the way the rest of the suite does, is what makes the marker unnecessary.

class TestEnvVsClientEquivalenceE2E:
    """The remaining half of "all six transport families" (split off this file which proved MCP/A2A/REST — the three
    IN-PROCESS families — only): the three LIVE families, E2E_REST/E2E_MCP/
    E2E_A2A, dispatched over real HTTP through nginx to a Docker stack.

    Same contract as ``TestEnvVsClientEquivalence`` above — ``env.call_via(T,
    ...)`` and ``AdCPTestClient(env).call(..., T)`` must dispatch the same
    production code and agree byte-for-byte on the wire — but every hop is
    real: real ``httpx``/``fastmcp.Client``/A2A JSON-RPC request, a real
    resolver reading the request headers, a real live-server response. Before
    this, ``Transport.E2E_MCP``/``Transport.E2E_A2A`` had ZERO callers
    anywhere against a live stack (confirmed: every existing reference is
    either the in-process E2E_REST-only BDD ledger or a mocked-httpx unit
    test in ``tests/harness/test_client.py`` — see
    ``McpE2EDispatcher``/``A2AE2EDispatcher``'s own docstrings in
    ``tests/harness/dispatchers.py``), so this is new live-wire coverage, not
    a duplicate of the in-process class.

    Honest caveat on what "equivalence" proves per transport, read from
    ``tests/harness/dispatchers.py``: ``RestE2EDispatcher`` (the
    ``env.call_via`` path) hand-rolls WRAP via each env's own
    ``build_rest_body``/``REST_ENDPOINT`` — genuinely independent of the
    generic client's address-table-driven ``_wrap_rest``, so
    ``test_e2e_rest_success_and_error_equivalence`` is a real two-
    independent-paths proof, the same kind ``TestEnvVsClientEquivalence``
    does in-process. ``McpE2EDispatcher``/``A2AE2EDispatcher``, by contrast,
    both delegate straight to the SAME ``_dispatch_core`` function
    ``AdCPTestClient.call()`` calls (their docstrings say so explicitly —
    a deliberate DRY choice, not an oversight), so their "equivalence" is
    guaranteed by construction, not proven per-test. Their real value here
    is different: this is the first time either DELIVER path
    (``_deliver_e2e_mcp``/``_deliver_e2e_a2a``) has run against a live
    server at all, and ``test_e2e_a2a_success_and_error_equivalence``
    caught a genuine bug on its first run — ``_deliver_e2e_a2a`` never sent
    the ``A2A-Version`` header the real JSON-RPC route requires
    (``a2a.utils.version_validator.validate_version``), so every live
    E2E_A2A call 400'd with ``VersionNotSupportedError`` before reaching
    ``AdCPRequestHandler`` (fixed alongside this test, same commit).

    Requires the ``e2e_live_config`` fixture (module-scoped, health-checked)
    — skips this whole class when no live stack is detected, so
    ``tox -e integration``'s no-Docker-app-stack contract is unaffected for
    every other test in this env; start a stack with `make test-stack-up` (or
    `./run_all_tests.sh`, which runs the full suite including this class) to
    exercise it.

    Tenant/product identifiers are ``uuid``-suffixed (unlike the in-process
    class's fixed literals) because ``e2e_live_config`` points factories at
    the live server's persistent ``adcp`` database — NOT the per-test
    ``integration_db`` these tests also request (kept only for the
    ``DATABASE_URL``-requires-Postgres skip semantics other tests in this
    file rely on) — so a second run against the SAME stack must not collide
    on a previous run's rows.
