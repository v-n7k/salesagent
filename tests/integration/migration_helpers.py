"""Shared helpers for migration integration tests.

Provides common utilities for tests that run Alembic migrations against
isolated PostgreSQL databases:
- parse_postgres_url(): Parse DATABASE_URL into connection components
- run_alembic_upgrade(): Run Alembic upgrade to a specific revision
- run_alembic_downgrade(): Run Alembic downgrade to a specific revision
- seed_account(): Insert an accounts row with raw SQL

The shared ``migration_db`` fixture lives in ``conftest.py`` (pytest auto-discovers
fixtures from conftest without explicit imports, avoiding F811 lint errors).

    ``billing`` is likewise raw: the CHECK-widening migration's tests must be able
