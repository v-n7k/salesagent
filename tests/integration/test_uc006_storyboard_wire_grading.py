"""RED grader: UC-006 storyboard Thens must grade the WIRE.

Core Invariant under grade (lane plan, verbatim): *every storyboard ``Then``
asserts a transport-observable signal, on every transport, through the guarded
accessors (``wire_dict``/``wire_field``/``assert_wire_error``); setup goes
through the env's per-transport primitive, never a direct ``_impl`` call.*

**Why this module exists rather than the liveness artifact.** The wire-grading §5
declares two graders: the per-scenario ledgered/live partition pinned in
``tests/integration/test_bdd_scenario_liveness_real_run.py:99-125`` — which
solution-review pass 3 (P4) defers, and which the wire-grading work **must not
modify** — and the REVERSION TEST, which pass-3 finding (d) requires to be *an
EXECUTED step in the grader, not a prose procedure*. This module is that
executed grader, plus the per-item mutations for C3 and C4 that the partition
artifact cannot see (the artifact records pass/xfail; it cannot tell a Then that
read the wire from one that re-serialized an in-memory object and got lucky).

**Why the Thens are driven directly instead of through pytest-bdd.** Finding (d):
the reversion "must run against a scenario P1 marks EXPECTED-LIVE, because an
xfail-ledgered scenario would SWALLOW the loud failure". Driving the step
functions against a ctx built from the LIVE scenario's own Given/When
(``T-UC-006-storyboard-format-id-roundtrip-on-sync``) satisfies that and, in
addition, puts the assertions out of reach of *any* ledger route — the conftest
tag sets and ``tests/bdd/e2e_rest_known_failures.txt`` both key on scenario
identity, and no scenario is being collected here. Same reasoning as
``tests/unit/test_bdd_uc006_storyboard_dispatch_fault_is_not_xfail.py``, which
drives the same module's Thens against an injected fault.

**Measured pre-Lane-C state** (this box, ``CreativeSyncEnv``, storyboard payload):

    transport   TransportResult.wire_response
    mcp         {'dry_run', 'creatives', 'status'}   real wire
    rest        {'dry_run', 'creatives', 'status'}   real wire
    a2a         None                                 <- the gap C1 closes

``CreativeSyncEnv``'s A2A leg calls ``sync_creatives_raw`` directly (its own
docstring says why), so it never routes through ``_run_a2a_handler`` and never
stashes a wire. ``then_response_envelope_schema_valid`` therefore falls back to
``resp.model_dump(mode="json")`` — a re-serialization of the in-process object,
which cannot catch an A2A framing regression because no A2A framing was
exercised.

**CB1 compatibility.** Every mutation below leaves the dispatch's TYPED PAYLOAD
populated, so a C2 implementation that keeps a payload guard (today's
``_require_response(ctx, ...)``) ahead of the wire read — which pass-3 CB1 makes
BINDING — passes these graders unchanged. Nothing here requires or rewards
deleting that guard.

**Where the payload lives.** The dispatch seams no longer stash a detached
``ctx["response"]`` copy: a provenance-stripped payload cannot tell a Then
whether it is reading a wire fact or an in-process reconstruction, so the
payload is read off the dispatch's own ``TransportResult`` through the guarded
accessors in ``tests/bdd/steps/_outcome_helpers.py`` (``payload_or_none``), and
the mutations below are applied to that result rather than to a ctx key. This
grader must not reintroduce ``ctx["response"]`` — the ambiguity it removes is
the same one C2 exists to grade — and ``tests/unit/test_architecture_bdd_wire_discipline.py``
pins the rule for the step modules these tests drive.

**Out of scope, deliberately.** C6 (the phantom-transport assertion) is graded by
the transport-set assertion already living in the Lane-D-owned liveness block;
this module does not restate it and does not touch that file. C5 (context echo
compared against the captured wire) is a test-side assertion-source obligation on
``CapabilitiesEnv``, graded structurally by
``tests/unit/test_architecture_context_echo_wire_grading.py`` — a behavioral
byte-for-byte echo test would redden for a PRODUCTION normalization defect
(measured: ``context={"trace_id": "t1", "channel": None}`` comes back
``{"trace_id": "t1"}`` on the mcp and a2a wire alike), which wire grading does not own.

    way production produces it.

    unreachable: ``wire_error_dict``'s missing-wire guard fired before the status
    was ever examined, so "the seller returned a transport fault" could not be
    observed at the assertion point on ANY path — a grader that cannot see the
