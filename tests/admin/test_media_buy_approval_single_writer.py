"""Who writes the media buy row when an admin approves it — and how many times.

``execute_approved_media_buy`` is the sole post-adapter writer, and the three admin
approval routes — ``workflows.approve_workflow_step``, ``operations.approve_media_buy``,
``creatives.approve_creative`` — must not touch the row after calling it. One approval
is therefore exactly ONE committed status write, carrying the flight-window status the
shared rule resolves plus the approval stamps.

Each route used to bolt its own post-adapter orchestration around the callee, and the
three disagreed with it and with each other. Nothing graded the combination, because
every test patched the callee out — which is precisely the mocking that let them
diverge. These tests run the REAL callee and mock only the ad-server boundary, so both
units-of-work, every commit, and every session close run for real against PostgreSQL.
