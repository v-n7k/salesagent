"""Shared L0 parsing layer for the pinned AdCP storyboard compliance tree.

Every ``scripts/audit/storyboard_*.py`` script and the ``make quality`` guard
(``tests/unit/test_architecture_storyboard_binding.py``) need the same
handful of structured facts out of the pinned compliance tree and our own
``.feature`` files: the pinned spec version, our declared protocols/
specialisms, a storyboard's ``required_tools``/``requires_capability``/
phases, a phase's graded check types, a tagged scenario's ``@source``
footer. Before this module each consumer re-derived these independently —
14+ primitives, 2-4 incompatible implementations each, six of which had
silently diverged into live bugs. This module is the single implementation;
every consumer imports it.

Deliberately import-safe: nothing here resolves a live ``~/projects/adcp``
clone at import time. ``dist_root()`` takes the clone path as an argument and
is only ever called inside a consumer's own ``build()``/``main()`` — the
``make quality`` guard runs in CI, where no clone exists, and reads the
vendored ``tests/fixtures/adcp_storyboards_pinned/index.json`` instead of
calling into this module's tree-walking functions at all.

Regex over raw text, not ``yaml.safe_load``, remains deliberate: one pinned
file (``universal/runner-output-contract.yaml``) is not valid plain YAML
(it embeds prose/code blocks), and it is already excluded by the ``track:``
predicate in :func:`storyboards` before any consumer would try to parse it
structurally.

    Why it exists: the conformance ledger keys on

    ``measured`` joined nothing for those steps: 7 ledger entries on
    ``universal/webhook-emission.yaml`` resolved to no record, and a check
    reading "no ledger entry" was not evidence that it passed.

    OWNER is ``triggered_by`` when present — matching the runner — and the step
    itself otherwise (``fetch_brand_jwks``/``assert_jwks_purpose`` carry no

    tagged scenario simply carrying no footer, which is its own (separately
    reported) violation. When an ``@source`` line IS present, its grammar is
    enforced strictly and unforgivingly: every token must be ``key=value``
    with ``key`` drawn from the closed set ``{repo, ref, commit, phase, step,
    path}``, no key repeats, and ``repo``/``ref``/``path`` are all present --
    anything else raises :class:`SourceFooterError`. ``path``'s ``#L..``
    line-fragment suffix is stripped.

    Order-agnostic over the ``key=value`` tokens (a prior implementation
    required an exact ``repo ref [commit] [phase] path`` order and silently
    failed to match any footer that didn't follow it).

    """Standard CLI: parse args, ``build_fn(repo, adcp)``, print, catch.

    One shape, for every caller: ``--repo/--adcp/--markdown[/--jsonl]``. The
    ``configure_args``/``build_args`` hooks that used to make the argument set
    pluggable had exactly one user, ``storyboard_reconciliation``, which took a
    required ``--proposals`` directory the repository does not carry; deleting that
    script (salesagent-b341x.24) left the hooks with no caller, and a pluggable seam
    nothing plugs into is a second shape waiting to be reintroduced. An audit script's
    subject is the repo plus the pinned bundle — guarded by
    ``tests/unit/test_architecture_audit_scripts_have_a_subject.py``.

    ``--jsonl`` emits one JSON object per line. A consumer that offers it is
    declaring that the JSONL is its SOURCE OF TRUTH and the markdown a
    rendering of it — so the two can never drift, and a new view is a new
    renderer rather than a new artifact.

    A :class:`StoryboardAuditError` raised by ``build_fn`` (a data problem
    the pipeline itself detected — a broken join, a malformed pinned file, an
    unresolvable citation) is caught here, printed to stderr, and turned into
    exit code 1. Turning a caught error into a process exit belongs to CLI
    entry points only — every library function raises the typed error and lets
    its caller decide, so importing these functions from a test or a sibling
    script never risks killing the importing process. This is one of two such
    entry points; a caller with its own argument parser supplies one
    and repeats the same catch.
