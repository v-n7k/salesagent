"""Join BDD scenario liveness into the storyboard-checks pipeline.

``storyboard_check_index`` derives ``covered_by`` from tag presence plus the
``@source`` footer alone — a ``@storyboard-v3.1``-tagged scenario with zero bound
step definitions has counted as "covered" forever, because nothing joined the
three liveness facts that already exist as data (the finding).
This module is that join:

* ``steps_bound`` — measured by a real ``pytest tests/bdd`` run, emitted by
  ``tests/bdd/scenario_liveness.py`` as
  ``test-results/bdd_scenario_liveness.json``.
* ``registry_wired`` — a DATA LOOKUP against the declarative
  ``tests.bdd.conftest.ENV_ROUTES`` registry, never
  reason-text matching. A scenario is registry-wired when its own ``T-*`` tag is a
  row (the per-scenario demonstrator), or the ``UC-<n>`` bucket its
  ``T-UC-<n>...`` tag derives — the same derivation ``conftest._detect_uc`` uses
  for a tag matching that pattern — is a row, and that row isn't a placeholder
  (``EnvRoute.xfail_reason`` unset). The registry only covers a subset of UCs
  today (see ``ENV_ROUTES``'s own comment in conftest.py); a scenario whose UC
  isn't in the registry yet is ``registry_wired=False``, not "unknown" — this join
  is deliberately conservative, and will only grow more scenarios into
  ``graded_by_live_scenario`` as the registry widens. This is why the join
  replaces the artifact's own best-effort, reason-text-derived ``harness_wired``
  field rather than trusting it: that field is only as good as the auto-xfail
  reason text conftest happens to produce today, exactly what this task exists to
  stop relying on.
* ``ledgered`` — read straight from the artifact, itself already a join of the
  e2e_rest known-failures ledger and conftest's curated xfail-reason bucket
 . Combined here with the conformance-ledger ``measured``
  column ``CheckRecord`` already carries (built from ``scripts/audit/ledger.py``'s
  ``load()`` against ``tests/storyboard/known_failures.txt`` — the third ledger)
  to flag a graduation candidate: a scenario we locally xfail as a known gap, for
  a check the real conformance run does not currently measure as failing.

A scenario absent from the artifact (no BDD run this session, or the run was
narrowed past it) is ``measured_this_run=False`` and reports
``steps_bound=False``/``ledgered=False`` — missing measurement renders as a gap,
never as a false "it's live" positive.
