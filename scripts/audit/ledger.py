"""Single owner for the conformance-ledger check-id grammar and curated YAML loaders.

Before this module, the ledger check-id grammar (``test_storyboard_check[protocol::
track::storyboard::step]``) had two parsers: ``storyboard_roadmap._ledgered_failures``
owned the regex, and ``storyboard_check_index._ledger_steps`` reached into that
module's underscore-private ``_LEDGER_ID_RE`` as a sibling view — the exact pattern
this repo's structural guards ban for ``storyboard_spec`` primitives, just not yet
enforced here. The two curated YAML loaders (the issue map, the wireability map) had
the same shape: one lived behind ``storyboard_roadmap._load_issue_map`` and was
reached into privately by ``storyboard_check_index``; the other was local to
``storyboard_check_index`` alone. This module is the one owner for all of it.

``LedgerCheckId`` is a LOSSLESS identity record: ``parse(line).format()`` reconstructs
the bracket content exactly, with no normalization baked in. The ledger spells
hyphenated ``universal/`` storyboard stems with underscores (per the runner's own
emission), while ``storyboard_coverage_map``'s stems stay hyphenated — joining raw
silently matched nothing before that was understood. Normalizing inside ``parse()``
would make identity lossy (a hyphenated segment could never round-trip), so the
hyphen-to-underscore join spelling lives on the derived ``storyboard_key`` property
instead; callers that join against ``storyboard_coverage_map`` use ``storyboard_key``,
never ``storyboard_id``.
