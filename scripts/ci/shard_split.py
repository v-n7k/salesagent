"""Deterministic CI test sharding for BDD parallel jobs.

Files are bin-packed HEAVIEST FIRST onto the shard holding the least work so far,
where "work" is the MEASURED seconds that file took in a recorded run
(``bdd_shard_timings.json``, refreshed by ``refresh_shard_timings.py``). Ties, and
files with no recorded timing, fall back to a scenario-count estimate.

Two things here were wrong before and each one alone unbalanced the split.

COST. The load was a file's Gherkin scenario count. A scenario is not a unit of
work: one may be an outline of twelve examples across three transports, another
may xfail at fixture setup for nothing. Measured on run innet_150926_0531 the
count called the two shards even -- 586 against 569, and their collected node
counts agreed too at 4096 against 4207 -- while they actually held 120 and 91
minutes. CI killed both at its 25-minute cap, one at 50% and the other at 88%.
The estimate cannot see a scenario going from dormant to executing, which is
precisely what this branch has spent weeks doing.

ORDER. Files were placed in sorted PATH order. Greedy bin-packing only balances
when the biggest items are placed first: sorted by name, a 45-minute file can
arrive last and land on whichever shard is already full. Descending cost is the
standard longest-processing-time rule, and it is what makes the greedy choice
below worth making.
