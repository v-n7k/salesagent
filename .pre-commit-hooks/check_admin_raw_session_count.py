Quality-ci hook: ratchet raw-session usage in src/admin.

The admin blueprints predate the repository/UoW pattern and talk to the
database directly — the repository-pattern guard family covers ``_impl``
functions and tests, so this surface had NO ratchet pressure and the debt kept
producing real defects (unhandled uniqueness races, driver text leaking into
operator responses, check-then-write shapes). Owner direction 2026-07-29: admin
code must migrate onto repositories/UoW; until each blueprint moves, these
counts may only shrink.

- Track ``get_db_session(`` and inline ``.add(`` (session/db_session receivers)
  counts under ``src/admin``
- Fail only when a count increases (new raw-session debt)
- Auto-lower the baseline when a count decreases
- Compares each baseline key against origin/main once the file exists there

Uses shared ``count_ratchet`` for the skeleton and JSON codec, mirroring
check_ruff_complexity_count.py (incl. the origin/main soft-land rule for keys
main does not carry yet).

    AST, not a regex over the text, and the difference is measurable rather than
    theoretical. The regex this replaces was ``\bget_db_session\\(``, which counted
    ``operations.py:403`` — the words "and get_db_session()'s exit closes the shared
    thread-scoped" inside a COMMENT — as one unit of raw-session debt. The baseline was
    190 against 189 real call sites, so one unit of the debt this ratchet exists to pay
    down was payable by editing a comment (salesagent-b341x.19).

    Its sibling ``\b(?:db_)?session\\.add\\(`` had the mirror-image hazard and, measured,
    no present instance: no receiver under src/admin is spelled ``local_session`` today,
    so renaming one would have silently lowered the count. A parse cannot be fooled by
    either, and the receiver pins below turn the remaining judgment — "is this receiver a
    session?" — into a reviewable list rather than a regex nobody re-reads.
