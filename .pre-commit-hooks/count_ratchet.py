"""Shared count-baseline ratchet driver for pre-commit / quality-ci hooks.

Extracted so type-ignore, duplication, ruff-complexity (and future mypy)
ratchets share one create / ``--update-baseline`` / compare / auto-lower
control flow (ADR-009 / #1613 review). Each hook keeps only its count
method; baseline codecs, CLI prelude, and tooling-failure guards live here.

A ratcheting baseline may only SHRINK, and enforcing that takes two compares,
not one:

1. ``current`` vs the committed baseline — every hook always had this;
2. the committed baseline vs an UPSTREAM ceiling — because the commit under
   test can also edit the baseline file, and (1) alone reads a raised baseline
   as the new truth.

(2) used to be an opt-in that four hooks each re-implemented as a ~40-line
near-copy and two — ``check_code_duplication`` and
``check_mypy_untyped_defs_count`` — never implemented at all.
``.mypy-untyped-defs-baseline`` was duly committed at 237 against a merge-base
value of 227 and rode through green. Two further paths in this module leaked
the same way regardless of the hook: ``baseline is None`` created the file at
today's count (so ``rm .type-ignore-baseline`` accepted any count), and
``--update-baseline`` rewrote it unconditionally.

So the ceiling probe is the DRIVER's, it is not optional, and it runs on every
path that can write — create, ``--update-baseline``, compare and auto-lower.
Growth is unrepresentable through the tooling rather than merely visible to a
reviewer; ``tests/unit/test_architecture_ratchet_hooks_use_driver.py`` keeps it
that way for hooks written later.

That probe is ONE-SIDED, and the other side leaked for just as long. It refuses
values ABOVE the ceiling; a count that is spuriously BELOW it is exactly what a
crashed tool produces, and ``min(baseline, current)`` waves it through. Since
this module auto-lowers on an ORDINARY run — no ``--update-baseline``, no
failure, no line a reviewer could act on — a pylint or mypy process that dies
partway through ``src/`` commits a ceiling nobody chose, and every honest run
afterwards fails with a message whose only documented remedy is forbidden by
policy (salesagent-b341x.20).

Refusing to write a suspicious number cannot fix that, because nothing about a
short count LOOKS suspicious: it is a smaller integer. So the fix is one step
earlier, at ``run_counting_tool``, which makes a short count unrepresentable
instead of detectable — a counter that shells out must say how the tool's
COMPLETION is recognised, and a tool that did not complete yields a refusal
rather than a number.

    a counter cannot be written that shells out without saying how completion is

    other:

    ``accepts_returncode``
        The exit statuses that mean "ran to the end". Not "did not obviously
        explode" — pylint's status is a bitmask and a fatal on ONE module sets a
        bit while the process still exits and still prints the hits it found.

    ``completion_marker``

        finishing (pylint's score, mypy's ``Found N errors ... (checked N source
        files)``). An exit code cannot distinguish a process killed at 60% from
        one that finished, and a signal death is not even in the tool's own
        vocabulary; the trailing marker can, because it is never reached.

    The evidence is echoed, so a run states what it measured instead of only
    what it counted. This replaces a ``has_findings`` predicate whose contract
    was "rc 1 is fine as long as SOMETHING was found", under which a crash that
    had already emitted findings was indistinguishable from a clean run.

    The echoed line also carries WHICH TOOL measured it — see :func:`_tool_version`.
