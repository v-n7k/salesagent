# A citation only helps if the reader can open it. These two forms cannot be:
# a path into .claude/notes/ points at a working note that is deleted when the
# work lands, and a review-round finding id (R1-19, SF-7, Chris-#2) exists only
# inside such a note. Both make an internal artifact load-bearing for the suite.
# Beads ids are deliberately NOT covered here: 733 of them already exist under
# src/ and tests/, so banning them is its own sweep rather than a forward-lock,
# and CLAUDE.md already directs FIXMEs at GitHub numbers.
# The beads-id alternation that used to be the third line here was removed: it
# contradicted the paragraph directly above it, and both were added in the SAME
# commit (26783202f), so one of the two was a slip. The comment is the one that
# holds up -- it names a checkable reason, and the count is now 478 beads ids
# under src/ and tests/. A pattern matching 478 existing occurrences is not a
# forward-lock; it made every file carrying one uncommittable, which is how it
# surfaced. The docstring below still says "either form", counting two, which is
# the same design speaking again. Banning beads ids remains "its own sweep".
