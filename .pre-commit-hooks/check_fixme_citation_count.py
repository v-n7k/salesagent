Quality-ci hook: ratchet local-beads-id citations in FIXME/TODO comments.

CLAUDE.md requires deferral comments to cite a GitHub issue/PR number, never a
local beads id (beads ids don't resolve for outside contributors — see
`FIXME(#<gh-issue>)` in "Rules for guards"). That rule had zero enforcement:
review round 2 of PR #1721 found 138 live `FIXME(salesagent-xxxx)` /
`FIXME(bd-xxxx)` citations already in the tree (19 in src/, 120 in tests/) with
no hook catching new ones. A binary hook would fail on every commit today —
this ratchets instead, per owner direction (2026-08-05): count may only shrink.

- Track `FIXME(salesagent-`/`FIXME(bd-`/`TODO(salesagent-`/`TODO(bd-` counts,
  per tree (src/ vs tests/) so a new violation in one tree can't hide behind a
  removal in the other
- Fail only when a count increases (new local-beads-id citation)
- Auto-lower the baseline when a count decreases
- Compares each baseline key against origin/main once the file exists there

Uses shared ``count_ratchet`` for the skeleton and JSON codec, mirroring
check_admin_raw_session_count.py (incl. the origin/main soft-land rule for
keys main does not carry yet).
