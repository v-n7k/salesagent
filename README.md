# Prebid Sales Agent

An open-source implementation of the [Ad Context Protocol (AdCP)](https://adcontextprotocol.org)
sales-agent role, maintained under Prebid.org. It lets AI agents discover and buy advertising
inventory through standardized MCP and A2A interfaces.

> **Status: alpha.** A pre-1.0 implementation of a pre-release protocol
> (AdCP 3.1.1), under active development. APIs still change between
> releases — `v2.0.0` introduced breaking changes — so pin a version and expect
> to adapt on upgrade. It is one of several AdCP sales-agent implementations,
> not a sole or canonical reference. The codebase is substantial and functional
> (Google Ad Manager integration, multi-tenant isolation, 16 AdCP tools,
> extensive tests), but treat it as alpha and validate before relying on it.

## What is this?

The Prebid Sales Agent is a server that:
- **Exposes advertising inventory** to AI agents via MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent)
- **Integrates with ad servers** like Google Ad Manager
- **Provides an admin interface** for managing inventory and campaigns
- **Handles the full campaign lifecycle** from discovery to reporting

## AdCP Compatibility

This implementation targets **AdCP spec version 3.1.1** via the `adcp==6.6.0`
Python SDK. The protocol is pre-1.0 — request/response shapes still move between
spec releases, and SDK bumps can change them. See
[docs/adcp-spec-version.md](docs/adcp-spec-version.md) for the SDK-to-spec mapping
and bump procedure. The pin is enforced by a CI guard
(`tests/unit/test_adcp_spec_version.py`), which fails on drift.

## Choose Your Path

| I want to... | Start here |
|--------------|------------|
| **Deploy my own sales agent** (publisher) | [Quickstart Guide](docs/quickstart.md) |
| **Evaluate or develop locally** | [Quick Start](#quick-start-evaluation) below |
| **Run a multi-tenant platform** | [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment/multi-tenant.md) |

---

## Quick Start (Evaluation)

Try the sales agent locally:

```bash
# Clone and start
git clone https://github.com/prebid/salesagent.git
cd salesagent
docker compose up -d

# Test the MCP interface
uvx adcp http://localhost:8000/mcp/ --auth test-token list_tools
uvx adcp http://localhost:8000/mcp/ --auth test-token get_products '{"brief":"video"}'
```

Access services at http://localhost:8000:
- **Admin UI:** `/admin` or just click "Log in to Dashboard" (test credentials: `test123`)
- **MCP Server:** `/mcp/`
- **A2A Server:** `/a2a`

For production deployment, see the [Quickstart Guide](docs/quickstart.md).

---

## Publisher Deployment

Publishers deploy their own sales agent. Choose based on your needs:

| Platform | Time | Difficulty | Guide |
|----------|------|------------|-------|
| **Docker** (local/on-prem) | 2 min | Easy | [quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) |
| **Fly.io** (cloud) | 10-15 min | Medium | [fly.md](docs/deployment/walkthroughs/fly.md) |
| **Google Cloud Run** | 15-20 min | Medium | [gcp.md](docs/deployment/walkthroughs/gcp.md) |

**Docker is the fastest** - it bundles PostgreSQL and just works. Cloud platforms require separate database setup.

The app itself is platform-agnostic — beyond the walkthroughs above you can host it anywhere:
- Docker (recommended) — any Docker-compatible platform
- Kubernetes — full k8s manifests supported
- Cloud providers — AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean
- Platform services — Fly.io, Heroku, Railway, Render

See `docs/deployment/` for platform-specific guides.

Because this is alpha software tracking a beta protocol, pin the version you deploy
and re-test after every upgrade — minor releases can carry breaking changes.

### After Deployment

Configure via the Admin UI:
1. Configure your ad server (Settings → Adapters)
2. Set up products that match your GAM line items
3. Add advertisers who will use the MCP API
4. Set your custom domain (Settings → General)

---

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prebid/salesagent.git
cd salesagent
make setup    # One command: installs deps, starts Docker, verifies health
```

See the [Getting Started guide](docs/development/GETTING_STARTED.md) for prerequisites, manual setup steps, testing workflows, and common operations.

---

## Google Ad Manager Setup

For GAM integration, choose your authentication method:

**Service Account (Recommended for Production):**
- No OAuth credentials needed
- Configure service account JSON in Admin UI
- See [GAM Adapter Guide](docs/adapters/gam/README.md) for setup

**OAuth (Development/Testing):**
1. Create OAuth credentials at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Add to .env:
   ```bash
   GAM_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GAM_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```
3. Configure in Admin UI: Settings → Adapters → Google Ad Manager

---

## Using with Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "adcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8000/mcp/", "--header", "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"]
    }
  }
}
```

Your token is shown once, when the advertiser is created in Admin UI → Advertisers; rotate it there if it is lost.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Container won't start?**
```bash
docker compose logs adcp-server | head -50
```

**GAM OAuth error?**
- Verify `GAM_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GAM_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`
- Restart: `docker compose restart`

## AdCP Tools

The MCP server exposes 16 AdCP tools (registered in
[`src/core/main.py`](src/core/main.py)). The server also exposes AdCP operations over A2A as JSON-RPC skills; the exact set differs slightly from the MCP tool list.

| Area | Tools |
|------|-------|
| **Discovery** | `get_products`, `list_creative_formats`, `list_authorized_properties`, `get_adcp_capabilities` |
| **Media buys** | `create_media_buy`, `update_media_buy`, `get_media_buys`, `get_media_buy_delivery`, `update_performance_index` |
| **Creatives** | `sync_creatives`, `list_creatives` |
| **Tasks / workflow** | `list_tasks`, `get_task`, `complete_task` |
| **Accounts** | `list_accounts`, `sync_accounts` |

## Ad Server Adapters

Adapters live in [`src/adapters/`](src/adapters/), are registered in
`src/adapters/__init__.py`, and are selected per tenant. The adapter interface is
defined in `src/adapters/base.py`. Maturity varies — GAM is the most complete;
the others are at earlier stages.

| Adapter | Key(s) | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Google Ad Manager** | `gam`, `google_ad_manager` | The most developed adapter (`src/adapters/gam/`). Supports CPM, VCPM, CPC, and FLAT_RATE pricing with automatic line-item-type selection. See [docs/adapters/](docs/adapters/). |
| **Broadstreet** | `broadstreet` | Broadstreet integration (`src/adapters/broadstreet/`), with Admin UI configuration. |
| **Kevel** | `kevel` | Kevel integration (`src/adapters/kevel.py`). |
| **Triton Digital** | `triton`, `triton_digital` | Triton Digital integration (`src/adapters/triton_digital.py`). |
| **Mock** | `mock` | Simulated ad server for testing and local development (`src/adapters/mock_ad_server.py`). Supports all AdCP pricing models; zero real spend. |

## Capabilities

**For AI agents**
- Natural-language product discovery
- Media-buy creation, updates, and delivery reporting
- Creative sync and listing with approval workflows

**For publishers**
- Multi-tenant isolation (data scoped per publisher)
- Adapter pattern for multiple ad servers
- Real-time activity dashboard (Server-Sent Events)
- Human-in-the-loop workflow/approval system
- Audit logging of operations
- Admin web UI with Google OAuth

**For developers**
- MCP interface (FastMCP, HTTP/SSE transport)
- A2A interface (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- REST API for tenant management
- Docker-based local and production deployment
- Unit, integration, e2e, admin, BDD, and UI test suites

## Protocol Support

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
The primary interface for AI agents. Built with FastMCP over HTTP/SSE transport.

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)
JSON-RPC 2.0 server for agent-to-agent communication:
- **Endpoint**: `/a2a` (also served on port 8091)
- **Discovery**: `/.well-known/agent.json` (also `/.well-known/agent-card.json`, `/agent.json`)
- **Authentication**: Bearer tokens via Authorization header
- **Library**: Built with `a2a-sdk[http-server]`

## Testing Backend

The mock ad server (`src/adapters/mock_ad_server.py`) serves a tenant configured with
the `mock` adapter and spends nothing. It answers every AdCP tool with simulated
inventory and delivery, and it honours two testing affordances that live in the data
rather than in request headers:

- **Keyword scenarios**: a media buy or creative whose name carries `[REJECT:reason]`,
  `[APPROVE]`, or `[ASK:field]` is rejected, approved, or sent to human review
  (`src/adapters/test_scenario_parser.py`).
- **Seeded delivery**: `src/services/delivery_simulator.py` writes per-buy delivery
  rows that `get_media_buy_delivery` returns verbatim, so an end-to-end test can pin
  exact numbers.

Requests carry no testing headers. A request is served the same way whether a test or
a buyer sent it; the only difference between them is the tenant's adapter.

## Using the MCP Client

```python
from fastmcp.client import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

# Connect to the server
transport = StreamableHttpTransport(
    url="http://localhost:8000/mcp/",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your_token"},
)
client = Client(transport=transport)

async with client:
    # 1. Discover products. Each product carries one or more `pricing_options`.
    products = await client.tools.get_products(brief="video ads for sports content")

    # 2. Book a media buy. Each package references a product and one of its
    #    pricing options. `idempotency_key` is REQUIRED (16-255 chars) — reusing
    #    the same key makes retries safe (returns the original buy, no duplicate).
    result = await client.tools.create_media_buy(
        brand="acme.com",                     # domain shorthand for a BrandReference
        start_time="2026-08-01T00:00:00Z",    # ISO 8601, or "asap"
        end_time="2026-08-31T23:59:59Z",
        packages=[
            {
                "product_id": "ctv_sports",
                "pricing_option_id": "cpm_usd",  # from product.pricing_options
                "budget": 50000,                 # amount in the pricing option's currency
            }
        ],
        idempotency_key="acme-ctv-2026-08-0001",
    )
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see our [Development Guide](docs/development/README.md) for:
- Setting up your development environment
- Running tests
- Code style guidelines
- Creating pull requests

### Important: Database Access Patterns

When contributing, follow the standardized database patterns. All data access goes
through SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM via repository classes — see the
[Patterns reference](docs/development/patterns-reference.md) and `CLAUDE.md` for details.

```python
# Use a context-managed session
from src.core.database.database_session import get_db_session
with get_db_session() as session:
    # Your database operations
    session.commit()
```

## Admin Features

### Multi-Tenant User Access
Users can belong to multiple tenants with the same email address (like GitHub, Slack, etc.):
- Sign up for multiple publisher accounts with one Google login
- Different roles per tenant (admin in one, viewer in another)
- Users are tenant-scoped via a composite unique constraint `(tenant_id, email)`

### Tenant Deactivation (Soft Delete)
Deactivate test or unused tenants without losing data:
- All data preserved (media buys, creatives, principals)
- Hidden from login and tenant selection; API access blocked
- Reactivatable by a super admin

### Self-Signup
New users can self-provision tenants:
- Google OAuth authentication
- GAM-only for self-signup (other adapters via support)
- Auto-creates tenant, user, and default principal
- Available at `/signup` on the main domain
